## The meat of the issue

### This is the way
So far the most promising part of "culture", almost every post talks implicitly or explicitly about this. Large differences can be found, and a lot of controversy, discussion and disagreement within the community. My initial characterization was that Python is one the strong end of "there is one way to do it", or better phrased "there should be one obvious way on how to solve things", while Perl embraces the freedom to explicitly say "there is more than one way to do it".
Ruby then falls somewhere in the middle, embracing a lot of the "freedom" Perl is known for, giving its strong propensity for meta-programming, monkey-patching and 'redundant' code-concepts like offering if- and unless-clauses.

However, so far it seems that Ruby actually has some of the strongest opinions on what should be 'the way'. While the language itself might offer multiple approaches, the community seems to have developed strong conventions it seeks to enforce.

Unsurprisingly, issues around how to set up virtual-env, modules and packages in general within the Python community is a funny (if painful) and highly controversial topic with strong, divergent opinions. Given that most of the posts are relatively old, it is good to see that things have developed in the right direction since then. However, just days before encoding this particular post, I had a long (and pained) discussion with a friend about this topic. He's an economist and often collaborates with others on scientific python code. How to run any given repo is still a big topic and pain point in his community.

#### Open Questions
- Currently, lots of the Perl questions simply offer multiple equal approaches without talking about why that is  good/bad.Should I maybe have a code like "answer offers multiple ways of doing things"?
- Carefully rereading my generated codes and how I ordered them, there seems to be an implicit narrative in my head that embracing more options and 'ways' is an expression of a feeling of freedom, which stands in a way in opposition to order and authority. Is this grounded in reality?

### Implicit vs. explicit
This was something I didn't initially anticipate to be a big topic, but so far  found some interesting codes for it. One of the Python mantras is "explicit is better than implicit", with the Ruby going with an almost opposite approach of saying "convention over configuration". In the ruby posts so far, very often people say things like "yes, you could do it this way, but for others it implies something you don't seem to mean".

## Admin, form and other things surrounding the thesis

### Why do I want to write my thesis in English

There are 3 main reasons for this: First, I am more eloquent in English than in German. This is slightly ironic for a german native speaker, but my school education was bilingual, and so was most  of my university and personal education. The language at my work is English, it is the language I communicate in with my partner and most of my friends, and I haven't written a german text other than some poems in English in close to a decade.
Second, there is some interest in my thesis by friends and coworkers. I hope they could give me some feedback, and possibly enjoy what I write, but they mostly do not speak German.
Lastly, since all the stackoverflow posts are in English, it requires a larger mental overhead to switch back and force between languages while encoding and making sense of the subject matter.
