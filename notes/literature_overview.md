## Hermeneutic practices in software development: the case of Ada and Python
https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v13n1/pdf/binzberger.pdf

### Abstract
This paper shows the relevance of hermeneutic philosophy to understand how infocommunication technologies frame our contemporary lifeworld. It demonstrates that the
programming languages are the result of collective interpretations of the general lifeworld of
programmers, management and political decision-makers. By having been inscribed into the
processes of language use, this general interpretation permeates the particular practices of
understanding that are possible within the language framework.
I support my argument by contrasting the hermeneutic concerns about the understanding between
programmers which stand behind the design of the Ada and the Python programming languages.
Ada, with its emphasis on achieving seamless communication through rationalistic
standardization and the technical embodiment of the background of understanding, bears the
imprint of the culture of Cold War-era DoD-funded military projects. On the other side, Python is
inscribed with a culture of open-ended discussion an

## 00 Anthropology: Crossing the Chasm
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/236338.236366

### Abstract

Abstract: Anthropology is the study of civilization, particularly its societies, customs, structure, and evolution. Our premise is that there are cultural “chasms” to be crossed to ensure the success of the technological beachhead established by innovators and early adopters of the 00 paradigm. Our panelists will address the following questions:
- What anthropological cultural factors have to be “matured” (and how?) to foster the success of the 00 paradigm?
- What mechanisms are required to facilitate communication between cultures of differing maturity?
- What cultural chasms must be crossed to develop a successful organization/culture within the framework supported by the object-oriented paradigm (or more perversely, is there anything “special” about the 00 paradigm)?
This panel will interest practitioners as a forum to share and debate experiences related to our current-day software culture metamorphosis.

# Applying grounded theory to (techy) online communities

## Someone like me: How does peer parity influence participation of women on stack overflow?

### Abstract
Stack Overflow is a learning community for software developers to share and solve programming problems with each other. However, women are often deterred from contributing questions or answers. Research external to programming communities suggest the presence of peers can increase activity from underrepresented users in unfamiliar spaces. To investigate the concept of peer parity, we studied how women participate on Stack Overflow and if the presence of more women on a thread enhanced their activity. We found that women who encountered other women were more likely to engage sooner than those who did not. We discuss how these findings can support women in programming communities through peer mentorship and increase engagement.


### Abstract
Online communities are flourishing as social meeting web-spaces for users and peer community members. Different online communities require different levels of competence for participants to join, and scattered evidence suggests that women can be overly under-represented. Moreover, anecdotal evidence of the Q&, A website Stack Overflow suggests that women withdraw from unfriendly online communities. Due to the lack of empirical evidence on the matter, this paper provides a quantitative study of the phenomenon, in order to assess the representation and social impact of gender in Stack Overflow. This study positions itself within recent and focused international initiatives, launched by the European Commission in order to encourage women in the field of sciences and technology. Our findings confirm that men represent the vast majority of contributors to Stack Overflow. Moreover, men participate more, earn more reputation, and engage in the "game" more than women do.

## The Role of Ethnographic Studies in Empirical Software Engineering
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7387744

Ethnography is a qualitative research method used to study people and cultures. It is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. Ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice, i.e., it can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. Despite its potential, ethnography has not been widely adopted by empirical software engineering researchers, and receives little attention in the related literature. The main goal of this paper is to explain how empirical software engineering researchers would benefit from adopting ethnography. This is achieved by explicating four roles that ethnography can play in furthering the goals of empirical software engineering: to strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineering; to inform the design of software engineering tools; to improve method and process development; and to inform research programmes. This article introduces ethnography, explains its origin, context, strengths and weaknesses, and presents a set of dimensions that position ethnography as a useful and usable approach to empirical software engineering research. Throughout the paper, relevant examples of ethnographic studies of software practice are used to illustrate the points being made.
