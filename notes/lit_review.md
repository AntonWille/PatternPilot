# Literature Review

## Introduction

After spending a significant amount of time trying to find similar research on this topic, I have found very little that matches my own research goal, that is; to use Grounded Theory Methodology to find and analyse unique expressions of culture in Programming Language Communities.
Researchers interested in cultural expressions of PLC's seem to come primarily from a philosophical background, and prefer using methods from this field like analytics, dialectics or hermeneutics. Where researchers from other fields, including SE broach the topic, it is usually defined to panels and books, and of course blogs and discussion forums.
Researchers using qualitative methods seem to be primarily preoccupied with topics closely related, yet different from my own research interest: One large focus area are cultural aspects of Software Engineering in companies or other teams. Another is on cultural and demographic aspects of specific platforms, such as research an male-female engagement on QA platforms, in mailing lists or open source projects.

## On the topic of cultural aspects of PLC's

One particularly interesting paper from the field of philosophy compares the hermeneutics of two programming languages, Ada and Python, and how very different design processes lead to different outcomes in adoption, project success and culture at large. While Ada was designed as part of a US Department of Defense project, with strong top-down leadership and a compiler strongly enforcing style and code practices, Python grew up in an environment closely linked to Open Source.

A panel discussion from the 1996 titled "00 Anthropology: Crossing the Chasm" between software practioners, cultural anthropoligists and SE researchers discusses the cultural chasm brought on by the principles of object orentiation in programming languages. One particularly interesting point here is the differentiation between what is the culture of OOP and the "paradigm" of OOP in the Kuhnian sense. Larry Constantine explains the pitfalls of looking at cultures as an almost linear function of development and maturity. He asserts that there is certainly an OO culture, but not necessarily an OO paradigm:

"If it is a paradigm in the strictest Kuhnian sense,
then object orientation is grounded in implicit
and unexamined assumptions that can only be
fully understood from without. These tacit
foundations not only color the cultural
interpretations of its adherents, but can
historically and dialectically be anticipated to
contribute to its own eventual replacement, not
by something necessarily superior or more
“mature” but most certainly by something
different that will likely incorporate its most
tenable tenets as a subset."

Dave West in contrast is not sceptical in the slightest about the status of OO as a pardigm, however qualifies this by stating that it is not a *new* paradigm, but sits comfortably within the philosophical paradigm of "Formalism", that according to him dominates modern discourse
