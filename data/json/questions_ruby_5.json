I'd like to go to the console and run different Factory Girl calls to check out what's happening. For example, I'd like to go in there are do...<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Factory(:user).inspect\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>I know that you can run the console in different environments...<\/p>\n\n<p>$ script\/console RAILS_ENV=test<\/p>\n\n<p>But when I do that, Factory class is not available. It looks as though <code>test_helper.rb<\/code> is not getting loaded.<\/p>\n\n<p>I tried various <code>require<\/code> calls including one with the absolute path to <code>test_helper.rb<\/code> but they fail similarly to this:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$ script\/console RAILS_ENV=test\n&gt;&gt; require '\/Users\/ethan\/project\/contactdb\/test\/test_helper.rb'\n  Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - \n  \/Users\/ethan\/project\/contactdb\/config\/environments\/RAILS_ENV=test.rb\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>Grr.
