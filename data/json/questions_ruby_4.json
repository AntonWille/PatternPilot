Sometimes `link_to` and `redirect_to` are explicit in the paths they&#39;re linking (e.g. `link_to &#39;New Person&#39;, new_person_path`), but many times the paths are implicit (e.g. `link_to &#39;Show&#39;, person`). \r\n\r\nI add some single table inheritance (STI) to my model (say `Employee &lt; Person`), and all of these methods break for an instance of the subclass (say `Employee`); when rails executes `link_to @person`, it errors with `undefined method employee_path&#39; for #&lt;#&lt;Class:0x000001022bcd40&gt;:0x0000010226d038&gt;`. Rails is looking for a route defined by the class name of the object, which is employee. These employee routes are not defined, and there is no employee controller so the actions aren&#39;t defined either.\r\n\r\nThis question has been asked before:\r\n\r\n1. At [StackOverflow][1], the answer is to edit every instance of link_to etc in your entire codebase, and state the path explicitly\r\n2. On [StackOverflow][2] again, two people suggest using `routes.rb` to map the subclass resources to the parent class (`map.resources :employees, :controller =&gt; &#39;people&#39;`). The top answer in that same SO question suggests type-casting every instance object in the codebase using `.becomes`\r\n3. Yet another one at [StackOverflow][3], the top answer is way in the Do Repeat Yourself camp, and suggests creating duplicate scaffolding for every subclass.\r\n4. [Here&#39;s][4] the same question again at SO, where the top answer seems to just be wrong (Rails magic Just Works!)\r\n5. Elsewhere on the web, I found [this blog post][5] where F2Andy recommends editing in the path everywhere in the code.\r\n6. On the blog post [Single Table Inheritance and RESTful Routes][6] at Logical Reality Design, it is recommended to map the resources for the subclass to the superclass controller, as in SO answer number 2 above.\r\n7. Alex Reisner has a post [Single Table Inheritance in Rails][7], in which he advocates against mapping the resources of the child classes to the parent class in &lt;code&gt;routes.rb&lt;\/code&gt;, since that only catches routing breakages from &lt;code&gt;link_to&lt;\/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redirect_to&lt;\/code&gt;, but not from &lt;code&gt;form_for&lt;\/code&gt;. So he recommends instead adding a method to the parent class to get the subclasses to lie about their class. Sounds good, but his method gave me the error &lt;code&gt;undefined local variable or method `child&#39; for #&lt;\/code&gt;.\r\n\r\nSo the answer that seems most elegant and has the most consensus (but it&#39;s not all _that_ elegant, nor _that_ much consensus), is the add the resources to your `routes.rb`. Except this doesn&#39;t work for `form_for`. I need some clarity! To distill the choices above, my options are\r\n\r\n1. map the resources of the subclass to the controller of the superclass in `routes.rb` (and hope I don&#39;t need to call form_for on any subclasses)\r\n2. Override rails internal methods to make the classes lie to each other\r\n3. Edit every instance in the code where the path to an object&#39;s action is invoked implicitly or explicitly, either changing the path or type-casting the object.\r\n\r\nWith all these conflicting answers, I need a ruling. It seems to me like there is no good answer. Is this a failing in rails&#39; design? If so, is it a bug that may get fixed? Or if not, then I&#39;m hoping someone can set me straight on this, walk me through the pros and cons of each option (or explain why that&#39;s not an option), and which one is the right answer, and why. Or is there a right answer that I&#39;m not finding on the web?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/1773367\/link-to-issue-with-inherited-active-record-class\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/702728\/get-route-for-base-class-of-sti-class-in-rails\r\n  [3]: https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/4432858\/broken-rails-routes-after-implementing-single-table-inheritance\r\n  [4]: https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/943300\/single-table-inheritance-routing\r\n  [5]: http:\/\/strugglingwithruby.blogspot.com\/2008\/10\/single-table-inheritance.html\r\n  [6]: http:\/\/blog.lrdesign.com\/2009\/03\/single-table-inheritance-and-restful-routes\/\r\n  [7]: http:\/\/www.alexreisner.com\/code\/single-table-inheritance-in-rails","link":"https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/4507149\/best-practices-to-handle-routes-for-sti-subclasses-in-rails","title":"Best practices to handle routes for STI subclasses in rails","body":"<p>My Rails views and controllers are littered with <code>redirect_to<\/code>, <code>link_to<\/code>, and <code>form_for<\/code> method calls.
