  <p>You don't have write permissions into the /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8 directory.</p>

<p>means exactly that, you don't have permission to write there.</p>

<p>That is the version of Ruby installed by Apple, for their own use. While it's OK to make minor modifications to that <em>if you know what you're doing</em>, because you are not sure about the permissions problem, I'd say it's not a good idea to continue along that track.</p>

<p>Instead, I'll strongly suggest you look into using either <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/" rel="noreferrer">rbenv</a> or <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install/" rel="noreferrer">RVM</a> to manage a separate Ruby, installed into a sandbox in your home directory, that you can modify/fold/spindle/change without worrying about messing up the system Ruby.</p>

<p>Between the two, I use rbenv, though I used RVM a lot in the past. rbenv takes a more "hands-off" approach to managing your Ruby installation. RVM has a lot of features and is very powerful, but, as a result is more intrusive. In either case, <em>READ</em> the installation documentation for them a couple times before starting to install whichever you pick.</p>

<p>Using one properly would prevent and can resolve your permission problem when executing a <code>gem update</code> command.</p>

<p>I recommend <em>rbenv</em>.</p>

<p>However, even when you use a Ruby version manager, you may still get that same error message.</p>

<p>If you do, and you are using rbenv, just verify that the <code>~/.rbenv/shims</code> directory is before the path for the system Ruby.</p>

<p><code>$ echo $PATH</code>  will show you the order of your load path.</p>

<p>If you find that your shims directory comes after your system Ruby bin directory, then edit your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file and put this as your last export PATH command:   <code>export PATH=$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH</code></p>

<p><code>$ ruby -v</code>  shows you what version of Ruby you are using</p>

<p>This shows that I'm currently using the system version of Ruby (usually not good)</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby -v

<p><code>$ rbenv global 1.9.3-p448</code>  switches me to a newer, pre-installed version (see references below).</p>

<p>This shows that I'm using a newer version of Ruby (that likely won't cause the Gem::FilePermissionError)</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3p448 (2013-06-27 revision 41675) [x86_64-darwin12.4.0]

<p>You typically should not need to preface a gem command with sudo. If you feel the need to do so, something is probably misconfigured.</p>

There are recipes for both below. Before you do, you probably want to turn off the installation of local documents for gems.</p>

<pre><code>echo "gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc" &gt;&gt; ~/.gemrc

<p>Then:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#readme" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>install rbenv</code> </a></p>

<p>run: </p>

<pre><code>rbenv install 2.1.2 (or whatever version you prefer)
rbenv global 2.1.2
gem update --system
</code></pre>

<p>This installs an up-to-date version of the gem system in your local directories. That means you don't interfere with the system configuration. If you're asking this question, you shouldn't be messing with system security, and you'll spend longer understanding what issues you may run into, than just having an easy way to avoid the problem you started with. Learn InfoSec later, when you know more about the operating system and programming.</p>

<p>For an alternative use 'RVM' instead: To <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install" rel="nofollow noreferrer">install rvm</a> run: </p>

<pre><code>rvm install 2.1.2
rvm use 2.1.2
gem update --system

<p>This has the same result, you end up with a local Ruby and Gem system that doesn't interfere with the system versions. There is no need for Homebrew, or over-riding system libs, etc.</p>

<h2>a way</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-chmod-and-chown-command/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> learn about <code>chown</code></a></p>

<p>I don't know if you like the command line, but this will make working on any project with any tool that installs packages to your system a breeze.</p>

<p><code>chown</code> as far as I can tell, stands for change ownership. </p>

<p>The reason I came looking for this answer is because <code>gem install</code> threw this error at me today:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don't have write permissions into the /var/lib/gems/1.9.1 directory.
</code></pre>

<p>This is a perfect opportunity to use <code>chown</code>. You see Ruby has given us the directory it needs access to, and it seems like it's a directory it will use pretty often.</p>

<p>In this case, there are only three things one needs to know to solve the problem, but <code>chown</code> is much more powerful, and grants you a lot more flexibility than I will demonstrate now. Please refer to the source at the bottom for more information.</p>

<h2>The Two Things</h2>

<ol>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Directory</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're in a shell finding the username is easy. Just look at the prompt.  Mine looks like:</p>

<pre><code>breadly@breadly-desktop:~\Desktop
</code></pre>

<p>The current user is just the name before the <code>@</code>. We know the directory from the error messages, but you have two choices. You can either limit your permission to the current version by using <code>../gems/1.9.1</code>, or give yourself write permission for gems of all version by using <code>../gems</code>.</p>

<p>The command to actually change ownership would look like this.</p>

<pre><code>chown -R $(whoami) /absolute/path/to/directory
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-R</code> is known as a flag and the <code>-R</code> flag typically tells a command to do something recursively, or in other words perform the command on every thing that is contained in the directory, and all the things contained in the directories contained within, and so on till there isn't anything else.</p>
<h4> the Tin Man, Comment 38995894 Score: 16: </h4>Changing ownership of anything in the /usr, /Library or /var paths, among others, is a bad idea.

It&#39;s ok to run a script that points to it, but create and use a sandboxed Ruby if you want to mess with it.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Felipe Francisco, Id: 25517327, Score: -6: </h3><p>I used this and worked.</p>

<p>If you already have root use enable on your mac in terminal type</p>

<pre><code>$ su

<p>If you dont have root user, you need to enable it using the following steps</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Apple menu choose System Preferences….</li>
<li>From the View menu choose Users &amp; Groups.</li>
<li>Click the lock and authenticate as an administrator account.</li>
<li>Click Login Options….</li>
<li>Click the “Edit…” or “Join…” button at the bottom right.</li>
<li>Click the “Open Directory Utility…” button.</li>
<li>Click the lock in the Directory Utility window.</li>
<li>Enter an administrator account name and password, then click OK.</li>
<li>Choose Enable Root User from the Edit menu.</li>
<li>Enter the root password you wish to use in both the Password and Verify fields, then click OK.</li>
