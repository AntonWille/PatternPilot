For any well-disciplined project that keeps clean test runs, this becomes <i>de facto</i> breakage.  Therefore, turning on deprecation warnings where there isn&#39;t a priority to remove the API in the immediately following release causes an unnecessary fire-drill among the Rails userbase.<h4> Comment by John Whitley, Score: 0, Id: 47973859, created_at: 2015-04-28 17:29:20+00:00 </h4>@GrantBirchmeier, it&#39;s &quot;discouraged in favor of the <code>*_action</code> family of methods&quot;, and will be deprecated in the future per @jryancanty&#39;s link above.

<p>Rails 4 make it developer friendly to change syntax <strong>before filter</strong> to <strong>before action</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>before_action</strong> call method before the actions which we declare, like</p>

<pre><code>before_action :set_event, only: [:show, :update, :destroy, :edit]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>set_event</strong> is a method which will call always before show, update, edit and destroy.</p>

<hr><h3>  Answer by yusefu, Id: 43246734, Score: -4, created_at: 2017-04-06 05:51:41+00:00 </h3><p>To figure out what is the difference between before_action and before_filter, we should understand the difference between action and filter.</p>

<p>An action is a method of a controller to which you can route to.
For example, your user creation page might be routed to UsersController#new - new is the action in this route.</p>

<p>Filters run in respect to controller actions - before, after or around them.
These methods can halt the action processing by redirecting or set up common data to every action in the controller.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rails 4 –> _action</p>
  
  <p>Rails 3 –> _filter</p>
