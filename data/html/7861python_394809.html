The expression syntax is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>a if condition else b
</code></pre>
<p>First <code>condition</code> is evaluated, then exactly one of either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is evaluated and returned based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type" rel="noreferrer" title="Boolean data type">Boolean</a> value of <code>condition</code>. If <code>condition</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, then <code>a</code> is evaluated and returned but <code>b</code> is ignored, or else when <code>b</code> is evaluated and returned but <code>a</code> is ignored.</p>
<p>This allows short-circuiting because when <code>condition</code> is true only <code>a</code> is evaluated and <code>b</code> is not evaluated at all, but when <code>condition</code> is false only <code>b</code> is evaluated and <code>a</code> is not evaluated at all.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'true' if True else 'false'
'true'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'true' if False else 'false'
'false'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that conditionals are an <em>expression</em>, not a <em>statement</em>. This means you can't use <strong>statements</strong> such as <code>pass</code>, or assignments with <code>=</code> (or &quot;augmented&quot; assignments like <code>+=</code>), within a conditional <strong>expression</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pass if False else pass
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
    pass if False else pass
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

&gt;&gt;&gt; # Python parses this as `x = (1 if False else y) = 2`
&gt;&gt;&gt; # The `(1 if False else x)` part is actually valid, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; # it can't be on the left-hand side of `=`.
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1 if False else y = 2
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
SyntaxError: cannot assign to conditional expression

&gt;&gt;&gt; # If we parenthesize it instead...
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x = 1) if False else (y = 2)
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
    (x = 1) if False else (y = 2)
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>(In 3.8 and above, the <code>:=</code> &quot;walrus&quot; operator allows simple assignment of values <em>as an expression</em>, which is then compatible with this syntax. But please don't write code like that; it will quickly become very difficult to understand.)</p>
<p>Similarly, because it is an expression, the <code>else</code> part is <em>mandatory</em>:</p>
<pre><code># Invalid syntax: we didn't specify what the value should be if the 
# condition isn't met. It doesn't matter if we can verify that
# ahead of time.
a if True
</code></pre>
<p>You can, however, use conditional expressions to assign a variable like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x = a if True else b
</code></pre>
<p>Or for example to return a value:</p>
<pre><code># Of course we should just use the standard library `max`;
# this is just for demonstration purposes.
def my_max(a, b):
    return a if a &gt; b else b
</code></pre>
<p>Think of the conditional expression as switching between two values. We can use it when we are in a 'one value or another' situation, where we will <em>do the same thing</em> with the result, regardless of whether the condition is met. We use the expression to compute the value, and then do something with it. If you need to <em>do something different</em> depending on the condition, then use a normal <code>if</code> <strong>statement</strong> instead.</p>
<hr />
<p>Keep in mind that it's frowned upon by some Pythonistas for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of the arguments is different from those of the classic <code>condition ? a : b</code> ternary operator from many other languages (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" rel="noreferrer">C++</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Go</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" rel="noreferrer">Perl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Java</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript</a>, etc.), which may lead to bugs when people unfamiliar with Python's &quot;surprising&quot; behaviour use it (they may reverse the argument order).</li>
<li>Some find it &quot;unwieldy&quot;, since it goes contrary to the normal flow of thought (thinking of the condition first and then the effects).</li>
<li>Stylistic reasons. (Although the 'inline <code>if</code>' can be <em>really</em> useful, and make your script more concise, it really does complicate your code)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're having trouble remembering the order, then remember that when read aloud, you (almost) say what you mean. For example, <code>x = 4 if b &gt; 8 else 9</code> is read aloud as <code>x will be 4 if b is greater than 8 otherwise 9</code>.</p>

<p>solution doesn't have short-circuit behaviour; thus both <code>falseValue</code> and <code>trueValue</code> are evaluated regardless of the condition. This could be suboptimal or even buggy (i.e. both <code>trueValue</code> and <code>falseValue</code> could be methods and have side effects).</p>
<p>One solution to this would be</p>
<pre><code>(lambda: falseValue, lambda: trueValue)[test]()

<p>(execution delayed until the winner is known ;)), but it introduces inconsistency between callable and non-callable objects. In addition, it doesn't solve the case when using properties.</p>
<p>And so the story goes - choosing between three mentioned solutions is a trade-off between having the short-circuit feature, using at least Python 2.5 (IMHO, not a problem anymore) and not being prone to &quot;<code>trueValue</code>-evaluates-to-false&quot; errors.</p>

<h1>Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/reference/grammar.html" rel="noreferrer">grammar file</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>test: or_test ['if' or_test 'else' test] | lambdef
</code></pre>
<p>The part of interest is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>or_test ['if' or_test 'else' test]
</code></pre>
<p>So, a ternary conditional operation is of the form:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 if expression2 else expression3
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression3</code> will be lazily evaluated (that is, evaluated only if <code>expression2</code> is false in a boolean context). And because of the recursive definition, you can chain them indefinitely (though it may considered bad style.)</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 if expression2 else expression3 if expression4 else expression5 # and so on
</code></pre>
<h3>A note on usage:</h3>
<p>Note that every <code>if</code> must be followed with an <code>else</code>. People learning list comprehensions and generator expressions may find this to be a difficult lesson to learn - the following will not work, as Python expects a third expression for an else:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[expression1 if expression2 for element in iterable]
#                          ^-- need an else here
</code></pre>
<p>which raises a <code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code>.
So the above is either an incomplete piece of logic (perhaps the user expects a no-op in the false condition) or what may be intended is to use <code>expression2</code> as a filter - notes that the following is legal Python:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[expression1 for element in iterable if expression2]
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression2</code> works as a filter for the list comprehension, and is <em>not</em> a ternary conditional operator.</p>
<h3>Alternative syntax for a more narrow case:</h3>
<p>You may find it somewhat painful to write the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 if expression1 else expression2
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression1</code> will have to be evaluated twice with the above usage. It can limit redundancy if it is simply a local variable. However, a common and performant Pythonic idiom for this use-case is to use <code>or</code>'s shortcutting behavior:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 or expression2
</code></pre>
<p>which is equivalent in semantics. Note that some style-guides may limit this usage on the grounds of clarity - it does pack a lot of meaning into very little syntax.</p>

<p>At first, the Python's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" rel="nofollow noreferrer">benevolent dictator for life</a> (I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Guido van Rossum</a>, of course) rejected it (as non-Pythonic style), since it's quite hard to understand for people not used to C language. Also, the colon sign <strong><code>:</code></strong> already has many uses in Python.

<pre><code>&lt;expression1&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;expression2&gt;

<p>So, firstly it evaluates the condition. If it returns <code>True</code>, <strong>expression1</strong> will be evaluated to give the result, otherwise <strong>expression2</strong> will be evaluated.

<pre><code>pressure = 10

<p>Ternary operators can be chained in series:</p>
<pre><code>pressure = 5
print('Normal' if pressure &lt; 10 else 'High' if pressure &lt; 20 else 'Critical')

# Result is 'Normal'

<p>The following one is the same as previous one:</p>
<pre><code>pressure = 5

    if pressure &lt; 10:

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Todd, Id: 60630600, Score: 10: </h3><p>Python has a ternary form for assignments; however there may be even a shorter form that people should be aware of.</p>
<p>It's very common to need to assign to a variable one value or another depending on a condition.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; li1 = None
&gt;&gt;&gt; li2 = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; if li1:
...     a = li1
... else:
...     a = li2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>^ This is the long form for doing such assignments.</p>
<p>Below is the ternary form. But this isn't the most succinct way - see the last example.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = li1 if li1 else li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With Python, you can simply use <code>or</code> for alternative assignments.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = li1 or li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The above works since <code>li1</code> is <code>None</code> and the interpreter treats that as False in logic expressions. The interpreter then moves on and evaluates the second expression, which is not <code>None</code> and it's not an empty list - so it gets assigned to <em>a</em>.</p>
<p>This also works with empty lists. For instance, if you want to assign <code>a</code> whichever list has items.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; li1 = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; li2 = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = li1 or li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Knowing this, you can simply such assignments whenever you encounter them. This also works with strings and other iterables. You could assign <code>a</code> whichever string isn't empty.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = ''
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = 'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = s1 or s2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I always liked the C ternary syntax, but Python takes it a step further!</p>
<p>I understand that some may say this isn't a good stylistic choice, because it relies on mechanics that aren't immediately apparent to all developers. I personally disagree with that viewpoint. Python is a syntax-rich language with lots of idiomatic tricks that aren't immediately apparent to the dabbler. But the more you learn and understand the mechanics of the underlying system, the more you appreciate it.</p>

<p>In this example, the condition x % 2 == 0 checks if x is divisible by 2. If the condition is True, the value &quot;Even&quot; is assigned to the variable result. Otherwise, the value &quot;Odd&quot; is assigned. The output will be:</p>
<pre><code>Odd

<pre><code>&quot;Even&quot; if x % 2 == 0 else &quot;Odd&quot;

<p>The ternary operator is a concise way to write simple conditional expressions in a single line. It can be particularly useful when assigning values or constructing expressions based on conditions.
