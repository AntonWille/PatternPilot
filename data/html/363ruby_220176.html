<p>This will skip the usual gem repository scan that happens when you leave off <code>--local</code>.</p>

<p>You can find other magic with <code>gem install --help</code>.</p>
<h4> JasonTrue, Comment 44147629 Score: 4: </h4>@BoratSagdiyev, a zip file is not a gem. Like most zip files, you need to unzip it before you can do much with it. If it contains a gem, then you can use gem install on the extracted .gem file. I don&#39;t remember the internals of the gem format; it&#39;s possible it may just be a zip file with a special header, but rubygems doesn&#39;t recognize zip files as such.<br><h4> Erran Morad, Comment 44145185 Score: 0: </h4>I download a gem such as rubygems in zip format. So there is no .gem file here. How do I install this from local ? Thank you.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Chris Bunch, Id: 220181, Score: 300: </h3><p>Yup, when you do <code>gem install</code>, it will search the current directory first, so if your .gem file is there, it will pick it up. I found it on the <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/command-reference/#gem-install" rel="noreferrer">gem reference</a>, which you may find handy as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gem install will install the named
  gem. It will attempt a local
  installation (i.e. a .gem file in the
  current directory), and if that fails,
  it will attempt to download and
  install the most recent version of the
  gem you want.</p>

<h4> Martin, Comment 107565528 Score: 4: </h4>I have a <code>Gemfile</code> but not a <code>.gem</code> file. So what is this <code>.gem</code> file? What should it contain? — Wait – I see. You mean an <code>gem-name.gem</code> file.

<pre><code># do this in the proper directory
bundle gem foobar
</code></pre>

<p>You can install them with rake after they are written:</p>

<pre><code># cd into your gem directory
rake install

<p>Chances are, that your downloaded gem will know <code>rake install</code>, too.</p>

<p><code>gem 'pry', path: './pry'</code></p>

<p>in a Gemfile.</p>

<p>... where <code>./pry</code> would be the clone of your repository. Simply run <code>bundle install</code> once, and any changes in the gem sources you make are immediately reflected. With <code>gem install pry/pry.gem</code>, the sources are still moved into <code>GEM_PATH</code> and you'll always have to run both <code>bundle gem pry</code> and <code>gem update</code> to test.</p>

<ol>
<li>Look into a computer with already installed gems needed in the cache directory (by default: <code>[Ruby Installation version]/lib/ruby/gems/[Ruby version]/cache</code>)</li>
<li>Copy all "<code>*.gems</code> files" to a computer without gems in own gem cache place (by default the same patron path of first step: <code>[Ruby Installation version]/lib/ruby/gems/[Ruby version]/cache</code>)</li>
<li>In the console be located in the gems cache (cd <code>[Ruby Installation version]/lib/ruby/gems/[Ruby version]/cache</code>) and fire the <code>gem install anygemwithdependencieshere</code> (by example <code>cucumber-2.99.0</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>It's DRY because after install any gem, by default rubygems put the gem file in the cache  gem directory and not make sense duplicate thats files, it's more easy if you want both computer has the same versions (or bloqued by paranoic security rules :v)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit: In some versions of ruby or rubygems, it don't work and fire
  alerts or error, you can put gems in other place but not get DRY,
  other alternative is using launch integrated command <code>gem server</code> and
  add the localhost url in gem sources, more information in:

<p>eg: </p>

<ul>
<li>bundle gem yourGemName</li>
<li>rake install</li>

<p>Take care of installing dependencies before installing actual gems.</p>
