All I had to do to revert to 0.37 was run your comment <code>sudo gem uninstall cocoapods</code> and then pick 0.38 from the automatically presented list. Within seconds I was back on 0.37, and my pod install worked again!

Not sure if this has always been the behavior, but <code>sudo gem install cocoapods -v 0.39.0</code> alone didn&#39;t do the trick for me once I had 1.0.0.<h4> Comment by nomann, Score: 0, Id: 101465953, created_at: 2019-08-14 15:53:12+00:00 </h4>You can also remove a specific version of cocoapods like: <code>sudo gem uninstall cocoapods -v 1.7.5 </code>.  This is specially useful if you want to revert to an older version as removing the current/latest version reverts it back to last installed version.

<p>Make sure you first get a list of all installed versions. I actually had the version I wanted to downgrade to already installed, but ended up uninstalling that as well. To see the list of all your versions do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem list cocoapods
</code></pre>
<p>Then when you want to delete a version, specify that version.</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem uninstall cocoapods -v 1.6.2
</code></pre>
<p>You could remove the version specifier <code>-v 1.6.2</code> and that would delete all versions:</p>
<p>You may try all this and still see that the Cocoapods you expected is still installed. If that's the case then it might be because Cocoaposa is stored in a <strong>different directory</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem uninstall -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods -v 1.6.2
</code></pre>
<p>Then you will have to also install it in a different directory, otherwise you may get an error saying <strong>You don't have write permissions for the /usr/bin directory</strong></p>
<pre><code>sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods -v 1.6.1
</code></pre>
<p>To check which version is your default do:</p>
<pre><code>pod --version
</code></pre>

<p>They can be removed using <code>pod spec remove SPEC_NAME</code> then <code>pod setup</code></p>

<p>One way to fetch a specific version is as follows:</p>
<p>First, you'll probably want to uninstall cocoapods:</p>
<p><code>brew uninstall cocoapods</code></p>
<p>Find a suitable cocoapods.rb e.g. by browsing the repo -&gt; <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/6b1477715df13e0ec4305c3420ac0c024867d34a/Formula/c/cocoapods.rb" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/6b1477715df13e0ec4305c3420ac0c024867d34a/Formula/c/cocoapods.rb</a></p>
<p>For cocoapods 1.14.3:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/6b1477715df13e0ec4305c3420ac0c024867d34a/Formula/c/cocoapods.rb  # or just download it
