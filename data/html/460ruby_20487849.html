<pre><code>sudo gem uninstall cocoapods
</code></pre>

<p>you can install a specific version of cocoa pods via the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install cocoapods -v 0.25.0

<p>You can use older installed versions with following command:</p>

<h4> SwiftArchitect, Comment 48071919 Score: 84: </h4>To see which version you currently have, run <code>sudo gem list cocoapods</code><br><h4> Erik van der Neut, Comment 51020027 Score: 10: </h4>This is brilliant! I had upgraded to 0.38, and with that version I was getting errors. All I had to do to revert to 0.37 was run your comment <code>sudo gem uninstall cocoapods</code> and then pick 0.38 from the automatically presented list. Within seconds I was back on 0.37, and my pod install worked again!

Not sure if this has always been the behavior, but <code>sudo gem install cocoapods -v 0.39.0</code> alone didn&#39;t do the trick for me once I had 1.0.0.<br><h4> allenlinli, Comment 87057470 Score: 0: </h4>If you see the error message &quot;You don&#39;t have write permissions for the /usr/bin directory.&quot; on macOS High Sierra, use: <code>sudo gem install cocoapods -v 1.3.1 -n &#47;usr&#47;local&#47;bin</code>  referenced from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2893889/how-do-i-fix-the-you-dont-have-write-permissions-into-the-usr-bin-directory?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=google_rich_qa&amp;utm_campaign=google_rich_qa" title="how do i fix the you dont have write permissions into the usr bin directory">stackoverflow.com/questions/2893889/&hellip;</a><br><h4> nomann, Comment 101465953 Score: 0: </h4>You can also remove a specific version of cocoapods like: <code>sudo gem uninstall cocoapods -v 1.7.5 </code>.  This is specially useful if you want to revert to an older version as removing the current/latest version reverts it back to last installed version. If there is no other version installed you can installed the one you want like: <code>sudo gem install cocoapods -v 1.6.0</code><br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Augard, Id: 31772875, Score: 103: </h3><p>Actually, you don't need to downgrade – if you need to use older version in some projects, just specify the version that you need to use after <code>pod</code> command.</p>

<p>Make sure you first get a list of all installed versions. I actually had the version I wanted to downgrade to already installed, but ended up uninstalling that as well. To see the list of all your versions do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem list cocoapods
</code></pre>
<p>Then when you want to delete a version, specify that version.</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem uninstall cocoapods -v 1.6.2
</code></pre>
<p>You could remove the version specifier <code>-v 1.6.2</code> and that would delete all versions:</p>
<p>You may try all this and still see that the Cocoapods you expected is still installed. If that's the case then it might be because Cocoaposa is stored in a <strong>different directory</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem uninstall -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods -v 1.6.2
</code></pre>
<p>Then you will have to also install it in a different directory, otherwise you may get an error saying <strong>You don't have write permissions for the /usr/bin directory</strong></p>
<pre><code>sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin cocoapods -v 1.6.1
</code></pre>
<p>To check which version is your default do:</p>
<pre><code>pod --version
</code></pre>

This directory may also need to be removed if you want a completely fresh install. </p>

<p>They can be removed using <code>pod spec remove SPEC_NAME</code> then <code>pod setup</code></p>

<p>It may help to do <code>pod spec remove master</code> then <code>pod setup</code></p>
