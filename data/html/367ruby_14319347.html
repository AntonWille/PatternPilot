<p><code>@title</code> is an instance variable - and is available to all methods within the class.</p>

<p>In Ruby on Rails - declaring your variables in your controller as instance variables (<code>@title</code>) makes them available to your view.</p>
<h4> Dan Devine, Comment 88690675 Score: 4: </h4>Thanks for the answer, have follow-up question...  Within a class that I&#39;m working on, the member variable is initially constructed like @options = {...}.  After this though, methods within the class access and make function calls with that variable as if it were local (i.e. &quot;options.merge()&quot;).     Is this just bad form?  Is there some other syntactic magic going in? (i.e. like making silent dup of variable, or making it &#39;const&#39; so that it can&#39;t be modified, etc)?  I&#39;m coming from a C/C++ &amp; Java perspective, and the really vague and optional syntax is driving me nuts!<br><h4> Msencenb, Comment 104876934 Score: 0: </h4>Does your class have an attr_accessor defined with the same name @DanDevine? attr_accessor is syntactic sugar that generates a getter\setter for you. If you are getting the value without the @ symbol the code receives the variable because it&#39;s calling the getter. Note this doesn&#39;t work the other way, you need to explicitly use the @ symbol if you are setting the var or else you&#39;ll just set a local var. Is this good style? Hard to say. I prefer to use the getter syntax in my methods in case the getter is overriden - I like to respect that encapsulation, even within the class itself. YMMV<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> joscas, Id: 14319521, Score: 41: </h3><p>Use <code>@title</code> in your controllers when you want your variable to be available in your views.</p>
<p>The explanation is that <code>@title</code> is an instance variable while <code>title</code> is a local variable. Rails makes instance variables from controllers available to views because the template code (erb, haml, etc) is executed within the scope of the current controller instance.</p>
<h4> AlexC, Comment 42976291 Score: 2: </h4>Thanks for this!

<p>The short answer, if you're in the controller and you need to make the variable available to the view then use <code>@variable</code>.</p>

<p>For a much longer answer try this: <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_classes.html" rel="noreferrer">http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_classes.html</a></p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Prabhakar, Id: 24575747, Score: 16: </h3><p><code>@variable</code>s are called instance variables in ruby. Which means you can access these variables in ANY METHOD  inside the class. [Across all methods in the class]</p>

<p>Variables without the <code>@</code> symbol are called local variables, which means you can access these local variables within THAT DECLARED METHOD  only. Limited to the local scope.</p>

<p>Example of  Instance Variables:</p>

<pre><code>class Customer
  def initialize(id, name, addr)
    @cust_id = id
    @cust_name = name
    @cust_addr = addr
  end

  def display_details
    puts "Customer id #{@cust_id}"
    puts "Customer name #{@cust_name}"
    puts "Customer address #{@cust_addr}"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example <code>@cust_id</code>, <code>@cust_name</code>, <code>@cust_addr</code> are accessed in another method within the class. But the same thing would not be accessible  with local variables.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Joe Hilton, Id: 20467309, Score: 4: </h3><p>A local variable is only accessible from within the block of it's initialization. Also a local variable begins with a lower case letter (a-z) or underscore (_). </p>

<p>And instance variable is an instance of <code>self</code> and begins with a <code>@</code> Also an instance variable belongs to the object itself. Instance variables are the ones that you perform methods on i.e. <code>.send</code> etc</p>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>@user = User.all
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>@user</code> is the instance variable</p>

<p>And Uninitialized instance variables have a value of <code>Nil</code></p>
