 <h2> Title: Perl flags -pe, -pi, -p, -w, -d, -i, -t? </h2> <h4> Tudor Constantin, question_id: 6302025, created_at: 2011-06-10 04:38:24+00:00 </h4>Score: 132, Tags: {perl,command-line,flags} <br><p>I have seen lots of ways of running Perl code or scripts, with different flags. However, when I try to google for what each flag means, I mainly get results to generic Perl sites and no specific information regarding the flags or their use is found there.</p>

<p>Below are the flags that I encounter most often, and I don't have a clue what they mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>perl <strong>-pe</strong></li>
<li>perl <strong>-pi</strong></li>
<li>perl <strong>-p</strong></li>
<li>perl <strong>-w</strong></li>
<li>perl <strong>-d</strong></li>
<li>perl <strong>-i</strong></li>
<li>perl <strong>-t</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I will be very grateful if you tell me what each of those mean and some use cases for them, or at least tell me a way of finding out their meaning.</p>

<p>The command line switches are all detailed in <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html" rel="noreferrer">perlrun</a> (available from the command line by calling <code>perldoc perlrun</code>). Going into the options briefly, one-by-one:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-p</code>: Places a printing loop around your command so that it acts on each line of standard input. Used mostly so Perl can beat the pants off Awk in terms of power AND simplicity :-)</li>
<li><code>-n</code>: Places a non-printing loop around your command.</li>
<li><code>-e</code>: Allows you to provide the program as an argument rather than in a file. You don't want to have to create a script file for every little Perl one-liner.</li>
<li><code>-i</code>: Modifies your input file in-place (making a backup of the original). Handy to modify files without the <code>{copy, delete-original, rename}</code> process.</li>
<li><code>-w</code>: Activates some warnings. Any good Perl coder will use this.</li>
<li><code>-d</code>: Runs under the Perl debugger. For debugging your Perl code, obviously.</li>
<li><code>-t</code>: Treats certain &quot;tainted&quot; (dubious) code as warnings (proper taint mode will error on this dubious code). Used to beef up Perl security, especially when running code for other users, such as setuid scripts or web stuff.</li>
</ul>

In <code>-0ep</code>  you are telling perl that &#39;p&#39; is a perl command instead of an argument.  That won&#39;t work out well at all.<h4> Comment by Ian Bytchek, Score: 0, Id: 42794745, created_at: 2014-11-26 13:11:48+00:00 </h4>Can you enlighten about the order of the flags? If I do <code>perl -i -0pe</code> everything works as expected, if I do <code>perl -i -0ep</code> it doesn&#39;t, if I change other flags order, it also breaks. What&#39;s the deal with that?

<pre><code>while (&lt;&gt;) {
# exec here

continue {
    print or die &quot;-p destination: $!\n&quot;;

<p><code>-e</code> allows you to pass a script to as a parameter rather than as a file:</p>

<p><code>-i</code> directs the interpreter that all data passed to <code>STDIN</code> by the executing script is to be done inplace.</p>

While STDIN is often associated with the controlling terminal, and is inherited from the shell that reads stdin and sets up the argument list to perl, they are NOT the same thing.<h4> Comment by zellio, Score: 0, Id: 7369231, created_at: 2011-06-10 13:22:54+00:00 </h4>plusplus, true, patching answer.<hr><h3>  Answer by liame, Id: 6325612, Score: 8, created_at: 2011-06-13 00:17:57+00:00 </h3><p>Other have mentioned perlrun.

<p>1 is represented by '???', because it is optimized away.</p>

<p>But remember, &lt;ARGV&gt; uses 2-argument open, so don't have filenames that start with <code>&gt; &lt;</code> or start/end with <code>|</code>.</p>

<p><code>-n</code> works the same as <code>-p</code>, only it does not print <code>$_</code> by default. This can be very useful in filtering text files.</p>

<p>In this way Perl can replace <code>grep | sed</code> in a single one-liner.</p>
