See <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open" rel="noreferrer">open()</a></em>.</p>

<p>When you open with "a" mode, the write position will <strong>always</strong> be at the end of the file (an append). You can open with "a+" to allow reading, seek backwards and read (but all writes will still be at the end of the file!).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test1','wb') as f:
        f.write('test')
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test1','ab') as f:
        f.write('koko')
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test1','rb') as f:
        f.read()
'testkoko'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Using 'a' is not the same as opening with 'w' and seeking to the end of the file - consider what might happen if another program opened the file and started writing between the seek and the write. On some operating systems, opening the file with 'a' guarantees that all your following writes will be appended atomically to the end of the file (even as the file grows by other writes).</p>

<hr>

<p>A few more details about how the "a" mode operates (<em>tested on Linux only</em>). Even if you seek back, every write will append to the end of the file:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('test','a+') # Not using 'with' just to simplify the example REPL session
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.write('hi')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.seek(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.read()
'hi'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.seek(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.write('bye') # Will still append despite the seek(0)!
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.seek(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.read()
'hibye'
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, the <code>fopen</code> <a href="http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/fopen/" rel="noreferrer">manpage</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opening a file in append mode (a as the first character of mode)
  causes all subsequent write operations to this stream to occur at
  end-of-file, as if preceded the call:</p>

<pre><code>fseek(stream, 0, SEEK_END);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Old simplified answer (not using <code>with</code>):</h3>

<p>Example: (<em>in a real program <strong>use <code>with</code> to close the file</strong> - see <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-343-the-with-statement" rel="noreferrer">the documentation</a></em>)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; open("test","wb").write("test")
&gt;&gt;&gt; open("test","a+b").write("koko")
&gt;&gt;&gt; open("test","rb").read()
'testkoko'

<pre><code>'w'   write text
'r'   read text
'a'   append text

<p>So to append to a file it's as easy as:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('filename.txt', 'a') 
f.write('whatever you want to write here (in append mode) here.')
</code></pre>

<p>Then there are the modes that just make your code fewer lines:</p>

<pre><code>'r+'  read + write text
'w+'  read + write text
'a+'  append + read text
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, there are the modes of reading/writing in binary format: </p>

<pre><code>'rb'  read binary
'wb'  write binary
'ab'  append binary
'rb+' read + write binary
'wb+' read + write binary
'ab+' append + read binary

<pre><code>def append(txt='\nFunction Successfully Executed', file):
    with open(file, 'a') as f:
        f.write(txt)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to write somewhere else other than the end, you can use <code>'r+'</code><sup>†</sup>:</p>

<pre><code>import os

with open(file, 'r+') as f:
    f.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
    f.write("text to add")

<p>Finally, the <code>'w+'</code> parameter grants even more freedom. Specifically, it allows you to create the file if it doesn't exist, as well as empty the contents of a file that currently exists.</p>

Mode    Description

'r' This is the default mode. It Opens file for reading.
'w' This Mode Opens file for writing. 
If file does not exist, it creates a new file.
If file exists it truncates the file.
'x' Creates a new file. If file already exists, the operation fails.
'a' Open file in append mode. 
If file does not exist, it creates a new file.
't' This is the default mode. It opens in text mode.
'b' This opens in binary mode.
'+' This will open a file for reading and writing (updating)

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Walt Howard, Id: 64081807, Score: 5: </h3><p><em><strong>If multiple processes are writing to the file</strong></em>, you must use append mode or the data will be scrambled. Append mode will make the operating system put every write, at the end of the file irrespective of where the writer thinks his position in the file is. This is a common issue for multi-process services like nginx or apache where multiple instances of the same process, are writing to the same log
file. Consider what happens if you try to seek, then write:</p>
<pre><code>Example does not work well with multiple processes: 

f = open(&quot;logfile&quot;, &quot;w&quot;); f.seek(0, os.SEEK_END); f.write(&quot;data to write&quot;);

writer1: seek to end of file.           position 1000 (for example)
writer2: seek to end of file.           position 1000
writer2: write data at position 1000    end of file is now 1000 + length of data.
writer1: write data at position 1000    writer1's data overwrites writer2's data.
</code></pre>
<p>By using append mode, the operating system will place any write at the end of the file.</p>
<pre><code>f = open(&quot;logfile&quot;, &quot;a&quot;); f.seek(0, os.SEEK_END); f.write(&quot;data to write&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Append most does <strong>not</strong> mean, &quot;open file, go to end of the file once after opening it&quot;. It means, &quot;open file, every write I do will be at the end of the file&quot;.</p>
<p>WARNING: For this to work you must write all your record in one shot, in one write call. If you split the data between multiple writes, other writers can and will get their writes in between yours and mangle your data.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> mattc-7, Id: 59309810, Score: -4: </h3><p>The simplest way to append more text to the end of a file would be to use:</p>

<pre><code>with open('/path/to/file', 'a+') as file:

<p>The <code>a+</code> in the <code>open(...)</code> statement instructs to open the file in append mode and allows read and write access.</p>

<p>It is also always good practice to use <code>file.close()</code> to close any files that you have opened once you are done using them.</p>
<h4> Erik Knowles, Comment 107607829 Score: 8: </h4>&quot;file.close&quot; is automatically called at the end of the &quot;with&quot; block, which is the advantage of the keyword.

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>for item in my_data:
    with open('results.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write(some_calculation(item))
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that <strong>every time the file is opened for writing, it will be truncated (cleared out)</strong>.</p>
<p>We <em>can</em> solve this by opening in append mode instead; but in cases like this, it will normally be better to solve the problem by <em>inverting the logic</em>. If the file is opened only once, then it won't get overwritten each time; and we can keep writing to it <em>as long as it is open</em> - we don't have to re-open it for each <code>write</code> (it would be pointless for Python to make things work that way, since it would add to the required code for no benefit).</p>
