These are special true and false values that can be identified using <code>is_bool</code>. This is an experimental feature at this time.</p>
<p>But while these could be said to return <em>the</em> true and false, they are are but <em>a</em> true or false value respectively. In fact, every scalar is either true or false.</p>
<p>The most complete, concise definition of <em>a false value</em> I've come across is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything that stringifies to the empty string or the string <code>0</code> is false. Everything else is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the following values are false:</p>
<ul>
<li>The empty string.</li>
<li>The string <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>A signed integer with value zero.</li>
<li>An unsigned integer with value zero.</li>
<li>A floating point number with value positive zero.</li>
<li>A floating point number with value negative zero.</li>
<li>An undefined value.</li>
<li>An object with an overloaded boolean operator that evaluates one of the above.</li>
<li>A magical variable that evaluates to one of the above on fetch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other scalar is true.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A note on &quot;true zeroes&quot;</strong></p>
<p>While numbers that stringify to <code>0</code> are false, strings that numify to zero aren't necessarily. The only false strings are <code>0</code> and the empty string. Any other string, even if it numifies to zero, is true.</p>
<p>The following are strings that are true as a boolean and zero as a number:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without a warning:
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;0.0&quot;</code></li>

Alan's example is a nice way of doing that using comparison of integers. Here's an example</p>

<pre><code>my $boolean = 0;
if ( $boolean ) {
    print "$boolean evaluates to true\n";
} else {
    print "$boolean evaluates to false\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>One thing that I've done in some of my programs is added the same behavior using a constant:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

use constant false =&gt; 0;
use constant true  =&gt; 1;

my $val1 = true;
my $val2 = false;

print $val1, " &amp;&amp; ", $val2;
if ( $val1 &amp;&amp; $val2 ) {
    print " evaluates to true.\n";
} else {
    print " evaluates to false.\n";
}

print $val1, " || ", $val2;
if ( $val1 || $val2 ) {
    print " evaluates to true.\n";
} else {
    print " evaluates to false.\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>The lines marked in "use constant" define a constant named true that always evaluates to 1, and a constant named false that always evaluates by 0. Because of the way that constants are defined in Perl, the following lines of code fails as well:</p>

<pre><code>true = 0;
true = false;
</code></pre>

<p>The error message should say something like "Can't modify constant in scalar assignment."</p>

<p>I saw that in one of the comments you asked about comparing strings. You should know that because Perl combines strings and numeric types in scalar variables, you have different syntax for comparing strings and numbers:</p>

<pre><code>my $var1 = "5.0";
my $var2 = "5";

print "using operator eq\n";
if ( $var1 eq $var2 ) {
    print "$var1 and $var2 are equal!\n";
} else {
    print "$var1 and $var2 are not equal!\n";
}

print "using operator ==\n";
if ( $var1 == $var2 ) {
    print "$var1 and $var2 are equal!\n";
} else {
    print "$var1 and $var2 are not equal!\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between these operators is a very common source of confusion in Perl.</p>
