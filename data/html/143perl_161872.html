1
$ perl -wle 'print !!0'

<p>Other interesting stuff: with <code>use overload</code> you can overload string literals and numbers (and for example make them BigInts or whatever).</p>

<p>Many of these things are actually documented somewhere, or follow logically from the documented features, but nonetheless some are not very well known.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Another nice one. Below the <code>q{...}</code> quoting constructs were mentioned, but did you know that you can use letters as delimiters?</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -Mstrict  -wle 'print q bJet another perl hacker.b'
Jet another perl hacker.

<p>Likewise you can write regular expressions:</p>

<pre><code>m xabcx
# same as m/abc/

<pre><code> $x = $a || $b;

 # $x = $a, if $a is true.
 # $x = $b, otherwise
</code></pre>

<p>This means one can write:</p>

<pre><code> $x = $a || $b || $c || 0;
</code></pre>

<p>to take the first true value from <code>$a</code>, <code>$b</code>, and <code>$c</code>, or a default of <code>0</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>In Perl 5.10, there's also the <code>//</code> operator, which returns the left hand side if it's defined, and the right hand side otherwise.  The following selects the first <em>defined</em> value from <code>$a</code>, <code>$b</code>, <code>$c</code>, or <code>0</code> otherwise:</p>

<pre>
$x = $a // $b // $c // 0;
</pre>

<pre><code>my $url = q{http://my.url.com/any/arbitrary/path/in/the/url.html};
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, the various quoting mechanisms in Perl are quite interesting.  The Perl regex-like quoting mechanisms allow you to quote anything, specifying the delimiters.  You can use almost any special character like #, /, or open/close characters like (), [], or {}.  Examples:</p>

<pre><code>my $var  = q#some string where the pound is the final escape.#;
my $var2 = q{A more pleasant way of escaping.};
my $var3 = q(Others prefer parens as the quote mechanism.);
</code></pre>

<p>Quoting mechanisms:</p>

<p>q  : literal quote; only character that needs to be escaped is the end character.
qq : an interpreted quote; processes variables and escape characters.  Great for strings that you need to quote:</p>

<pre><code>my $var4 = qq{This "$mechanism" is broken.  Please inform "$user" at "$email" about it.};
</code></pre>

<p>qx : Works like qq, but then executes it as a system command, non interactively.  Returns all the text generated from the standard out.  (Redirection, if supported in the OS, also comes out)  Also done with back quotes (the ` character).</p>

<pre><code>my $output  = qx{type "$path"};      # get just the output
my $moreout = qx{type "$path" 2&gt;&amp;1}; # get stuff on stderr too
</code></pre>

<p>qr : Interprets like qq, but then compiles it as a regular expression.  Works with the various options on the regex as well.  You can now pass the regex around as a variable:</p>

<pre><code>sub MyRegexCheck {
    my ($string, $regex) = @_;
    if ($string)
    {
       return ($string =~ $regex);
    }
    return; # returns 'null' or 'empty' in every context
}

my $regex = qr{http://[\w]\.com/([\w]+/)+};
@results = MyRegexCheck(q{http://myurl.com/subpath1/subpath2/}, $regex);
</code></pre>

<p>qw : A very, very useful quote operator.  Turns a quoted set of whitespace separated words into a list.  Great for filling in data in a unit test.</p>

<pre><code>
   my @allowed = qw(A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z { });
   my @badwords = qw(WORD1 word2 word3 word4);
   my @numbers = qw(one two three four 5 six seven); # works with numbers too
   my @list = ('string with space', qw(eight nine), "a $var"); # works in other lists
   my $arrayref = [ qw(and it works in arrays too) ]; 
</code></pre>

<p>They're great to use them whenever it makes things clearer.  For qx, qq, and q, I most likely use the {} operators.  The most common habit of people using qw is usually the () operator, but sometimes you also see qw//.</p>

<p>I'd say the ability to expand the language, creating pseudo block operations is one.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You declare the prototype for a sub indicating that it takes a code reference first:</p>

<pre><code>sub do_stuff_with_a_hash (&amp;\%) {
    my ( $block_of_code, $hash_ref ) = @_;
    while ( my ( $k, $v ) = each %$hash_ref ) { 
        $block_of_code-&gt;( $k, $v );
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You can then call it in the body like so </p>

<pre><code>use Data::Dumper;

do_stuff_with_a_hash {
    local $Data::Dumper::Terse = 1;
    my ( $k, $v ) = @_;
    say qq(Hey, the key   is "$k"!);
    say sprintf qq(Hey, the value is "%v"!), Dumper( $v );

} %stuff_for
;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>(<code>Data::Dumper::Dumper</code> is another semi-hidden gem.) Notice how you don't need the <code>sub</code> keyword in front of the block, or the comma before the hash. It ends up looking a lot like: <code>map { } @list</code></p>

<h3>Source Filters</h3>

<p>Also, there are source filters. Where Perl will pass you the code so you can manipulate it. Both this, and the block operations, are pretty much don't-try-this-at-home type of things. </p>

<p>I have done some neat things with source filters, for example like creating a very simple language to check the time, allowing short Perl one-liners for some decision making:</p>

<pre><code>perl -MLib::DB -MLib::TL -e 'run_expensive_database_delete() if $hour_of_day &lt; AM_7';
</code></pre>

<p><code>Lib::TL</code> would just scan for both the "variables" and the constants, create them and substitute them as needed. </p>

<p>Again, source filters can be messy, but are powerful. But they can mess debuggers up something terrible--and even warnings can be printed with the wrong line numbers. I stopped using Damian's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Switch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Switch</a> because the debugger would lose all ability to tell me where I really was. But I've found that you can minimize the damage by modifying small sections of code, keeping them on the same line. </p>

<h3>Signal Hooks</h3>

<p>It's often enough done, but it's not all that obvious. Here's a die handler that piggy backs on the old one.  </p>

<pre><code>my $old_die_handler = $SIG{__DIE__};
$SIG{__DIE__}       
    = sub { say q(Hey! I'm DYIN' over here!); goto &amp;$old_die_handler; }
    ;
</code></pre>

<p>That means whenever some other module in the code wants to die, they gotta come to you (unless someone else does a destructive overwrite on <code>$SIG{__DIE__}</code>). And you can be notified that somebody things something is an error. </p>

<p>Of course, for enough things you can just use an <code>END { }</code> block, if all you want to do is clean up. </p>

<h3><code>overload::constant</code></h3>

<p>You can inspect literals of a certain type in packages that include your module. For example, if you use this in your <code>import</code> sub:</p>

<pre><code>overload::constant 
    integer =&gt; sub { 
        my $lit = shift;
        return $lit &gt; 2_000_000_000 ? Math::BigInt-&gt;new( $lit ) : $lit 
    };
</code></pre>

<p>it will mean that every integer greater than 2 billion in the calling packages will get changed to a <code>Math::BigInt</code> object. (See <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?overload#Overloading_constants" rel="nofollow noreferrer">overload::constant</a>).</p>

<h3>Grouped Integer Literals</h3>

<p>While we're at it. Perl allows you to break up large numbers into groups of three digits and still get a parsable integer out of it. Note <code>2_000_000_000</code> above for 2 billion. </p>

I stumbled on this while digging around in the Perl parser.</p>

<p>Before there was POD, perl4 had a trick to allow you to embed the man page, as nroff, straight into your program so it wouldn't get lost.  perl4 used a program called <a href="http://www.cpan.org/scripts/nutshell/ch6/wrapman" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wrapman</a> (see Pink Camel page 319 for some details) to cleverly embed an nroff man page into your script.</p>

<p>It worked by telling nroff to ignore all the code, and then put the meat of the man page after an <strong>END</strong> tag which tells Perl to stop processing code.  Looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
'di';
'ig00';

...Perl code goes here, ignored by nroff...

.00;        # finish .ig

'di         \" finish the diversion
.nr nl 0-1  \" fake up transition to first page
.nr % 0     \" start at page 1
'; __END__

...man page goes here, ignored by Perl...
</code></pre>

<p>The details of the roff magic escape me, but you'll notice that the roff commands are strings or numbers in void context.  Normally a constant in void context produces a warning.

$var = "foo";

<p>gives you this helpful message:</p>

<pre>
Global symbol "$var" requires explicit package name at - line 4.
Execution of - aborted due to compilation errors (#1)
    (F) You've said "use strict vars", which indicates that all variables
    must either be lexically scoped (using "my"), declared beforehand using
    "our", or explicitly qualified to say which package the global variable
    is in (using "::").

<pre><code>use diagnostics;
use strict;

sub myname {

};
</code></pre>

<p>you get this large, helpful chunk of text:</p>

<pre>
syntax error at - line 5, near "};"
Execution of - aborted due to compilation errors (#1)
(F) Probably means you had a syntax error.  Common reasons include:

    A keyword is misspelled.
    A semicolon is missing.
    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
    An opening or closing brace is missing.
    A closing quote is missing.

Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on -w.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
perl -c repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of S.

Uncaught exception from user code:
    syntax error at - line 5, near "};"
Execution of - aborted due to compilation errors.
at - line 7
</pre>

<p>From there you can go about deducing what might be wrong with your program (in this case, print is formatted entirely wrong).  There's a large number of known errors with diagnostics.

<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/B/Concise.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Doc on Concise</a></p>

<p>Besides being exquisitely flexible, expressive and amenable to programing in the style of C, Pascal, Python and other languages, there are several pragmas command switches that make Perl my 'goto' language for initial kanoodling on an algorithm, regex, or quick problems that needs to be solved. These two are unique to Perl I believe, and are among my favorites. </p>

<p><code>use re debug</code>:
Most modern flavors of regular expressions owe their current form and function to Perl. While there are many Perl forms of regex that cannot be expressed in other languages, there are almost no forms of other languages' flavor of regex that cannot be expressed in Perl. Additionally, Perl has a wonderful regex debugger built in to show how the regex engine is interpreting your regex and matching against the target string. </p>

<p>Example: I recently was trying to write a simple CSV routine. (Yes, yes, I know, I should have been using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ALANCITT/Text-CSV-0.01/CSV.pm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Text::CSV...</a>) but the CSV values were not quoted and simple. </p>

<p>My first take was <code>/^(^(?:(.*?),){$i}/</code> to extract the i record on n CSV records. That works fine -- except for the last record or n of n. I could see that without the debugger.</p>

<p>Next I tried <code>/^(?:(.*?),|$){$i}/</code> This did not work, and I could not see immediately why. I thought I was saying <code>(.*?)</code> followed by a comma or EOL. Then I added <code>use re debug</code> at the top of a small test script. Ahh yes, the alteration between <code>,|$</code> was not being interpreted that way; it was being interpreted as <code>((.*?),) | ($)</code> -- not what I wanted. </p>

<p><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrequick.html#Grouping-things-and-hierarchical-matching" rel="nofollow noreferrer">A new grouping was needed</a>. So I arrived at the working <code>/^(?:(.*?)(?:,|$)){$i}/</code>. While I was in the regex debugger, I was surprised how many loops it took for a match towards the end of the string. It is the <code>.*?</code> term that is quite ambiguous and requires excessive backtracking to satisfy. So I tried <code>/^(?:(?:^|,)([^,]*)){$i}/</code> This does two things: 1) reduces backtracking because of the greedy match of all but a comma 2) allowed the regex optimizer to only use the alteration once on the first field. Using Benchmark, this is 35% faster than the first regex. The regex debugger is wonderful and few use it.</p>

<p><code>perl -MO=Concise[,OPTIONS]</code>:
The B and Concise frameworks are tremendous tools to see how Perl is interpreting your masterpiece. Using the <code>-MO=Concise</code> prints the result of the Perl interpreters translation of your source code. There are many options to Concise and in B, you can write your own presentation of the OP codes. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/885908/while-1-vs-for-is-there-a-speed-difference/885951#885951">in this post</a>, you can use Concise to compare different code structures. You can interleave your source lines with the OP codes those lines generate. Check it out.</p>
