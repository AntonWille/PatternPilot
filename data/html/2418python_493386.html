 <h2> Title: How to print without a newline or space </h2> <h3> Andrea Ambu, question_id: 493386 </h3>Score: 2418, Tags: {python,trailing-newline} <br><p>Consider these examples using <code>print</code> in Python:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(4): print('.')
.
.
.
.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('.', '.', '.', '.')
. . . .
</code></pre>
<p>Either a newline or a space is added between each value. How can I avoid that, so that the output is <code>....</code> instead? In other words, how can I &quot;append&quot; strings to the standard output stream?</p>
<h4> Comment 8999807 guettli: </h4>For those who search the string formating documentation of python: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting</a><br><h4> Comment 116018639 Dock: </h4>Bit late to the party, but why not <code>print(&quot;.&quot; * 10)</code>?<br><h4> Comment 96167954 Vignesh Bayari R.: </h4>Looks like a similar question had been asked previously: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/255147/9325817">https://stackoverflow.com/q/255147/9325817</a><br><h4> Comment 118524708 Hitesh Garg: </h4>Explanation on <a href="https://www.codingeek.com/tutorials/python/python-io-user-input-ouput/#2_how_to_print_output_to_the_screen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">how to use <code>sep</code> and <code>end</code> in python print statement</a><br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 17494240 Subbu: </h3><p>You can do the same in Python 3 as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#!usr/bin/python

i = 0
while i&lt;10 :
    print('.', end='')
    i = i+1
</code></pre>
<p>And execute it with <code>python filename.py</code> or <code>python3 filename.py</code>.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 493399 codelogic: </h3><p>In Python 3, you can use the <code>sep=</code> and <code>end=</code> parameters of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#print" rel="noreferrer"><code>print</code></a> function:</p>

<p>To not add a newline to the end of the string:</p>

<pre><code>print('.', end='')
</code></pre>

<p>To not add a space between all the function arguments you want to print:</p>

<pre><code>print('a', 'b', 'c', sep='')
</code></pre>

<p>You can pass any string to either parameter, and you can use both parameters at the same time.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble with buffering, you can flush the output by adding <code>flush=True</code> keyword argument:</p>

<pre><code>print('.', end='', flush=True)
</code></pre>

<h2>Python 2.6 and 2.7</h2>

<p>From Python 2.6 you can either import the <code>print</code> function from Python 3 using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>__future__</code> module</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
</code></pre>

<p>which allows you to use the Python 3 solution above.</p>

<p>However, note that the <code>flush</code> keyword is not available in the version of the <code>print</code> function imported from <code>__future__</code> in Python 2; it only works in Python 3, more specifically 3.3 and later. In earlier versions you'll still need to flush manually with a call to <code>sys.stdout.flush()</code>. You'll also have to rewrite all other print statements in the file where you do this import.</p>

<p>Or you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.stdout" rel="noreferrer"><code>sys.stdout.write()</code></a></p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.stdout.write('.')
</code></pre>

<p>You may also need to call</p>

<pre><code>sys.stdout.flush()
</code></pre>

<p>to ensure <code>stdout</code> is flushed immediately.</p>
<h4> Comment 95851263 Rishav: </h4>Can someone explain why would I need to <code>flush</code> and what does it do actually?<br><h4> Comment 83381606 gunit: </h4>Thanks! In Python 3.6.3, that flush=True is crucial, or else it doesn&#39;t work as intended.<br><h4> Comment 99936286 Great Turtle: </h4>It&#39;s a few months late, but to answer @Rishav flush empties the buffer and displays the output right now. Without flush you might have your exact text printed eventually, but only when the system gets around to processing the graphics instead of the IO.  Flush makes the text visible immediately by &quot;flushing&quot; the cache.<br><h4> Comment 113015114 David Parks: </h4>If you&#39;re having trouble with buffering you can unbuffer all python output with <code>python -u my.py</code>.

<p>Yes, append a comma after the last argument to print. For instance, this loop prints the numbers 0..9 on a line separated by spaces. Note the parameterless &quot;print&quot; that adds the final newline:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('hello')

<h4> Comment 64464727 pppery: </h4>Breaks <code>sys.__stdout__</code><br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 28778131 DisneyWizard: </h3><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/493386/how-to-print-without-a-newline-or-space/4348063#4348063">lenooh satisfied</a> my query. I discovered this article while searching for 'python suppress newline'. I'm using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IDLE 3</a> on Raspberry Pi to develop Python 3.2 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PuTTY</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a progress bar on the PuTTY command line. I didn't want the page scrolling away. I wanted a horizontal line to reassure the user from freaking out that the program hasn't cruncxed to a halt nor been sent to lunch on a merry infinite loop - as a plea to 'leave me be, I'm doing fine, but this may take some time.' interactive message - like a progress bar in text.</p>
<p>The <code>print('Skimming for', search_string, '\b! .001', end='')</code> initializes the message by preparing for the next screen-write, which will print three backspaces as ⌫⌫⌫ rubout and then a period, wiping off '001' and extending the line of periods.</p>
<p>After <code>search_string</code> parrots user input, the <code>\b!</code> trims the exclamation point of my <code>search_string</code> text to back over the space which <code>print()</code> otherwise forces, properly placing the punctuation. That's followed by a space and the first 'dot' of the 'progress bar' which I'm simulating.</p>
<p>Unnecessarily, the message is also then primed with the page number (formatted to a length of three with leading zeros) to take notice from the user that progress is being processed and which will also reflect the count of periods we will later build out to the right.</p>
<pre><code>import sys

page=1
search_string=input('Search for?',)
print('Skimming for', search_string, '\b! .001', end='')
sys.stdout.flush() # the print function with an end='' won't print unless forced
while page:
    # some stuff…
    # search, scrub, and build bulk output list[], count items,
    # set done flag True
    page=page+1 #done flag set in 'some_stuff'
    sys.stdout.write('\b\b\b.'+format(page, '03')) #&lt;-- here's the progress bar meat
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if done: #( flag alternative to break, exit or quit)
        print('\nSorting', item_count, 'items')
        page=0 # exits the 'while page' loop
list.sort()
for item_count in range(0, items)
    print(list[item_count])

#print footers here
if not (len(list)==items):
    print('#error_handler')
</code></pre>
<p>The progress bar meat is in the <code>sys.stdout.write('\b\b\b.'+format(page, '03'))</code> line. First, to erase to the left, it backs up the cursor over the three numeric characters with the '\b\b\b' as ⌫⌫⌫ rubout and drops a new period to add to the progress bar length. Then it writes three digits of the page it has progressed to so far. Because <code>sys.stdout.write()</code> waits for a full buffer or the output channel to close, the <code>sys.stdout.flush()</code> forces the immediate write. <code>sys.stdout.flush()</code> is built into the end of <code>print()</code> which is bypassed with <code>print(txt, end='' )</code>. Then the code loops through its mundane time intensive operations while it prints nothing more until it returns here to wipe three digits back, add a period and write three digits again, incremented.</p>
<p>The three digits wiped and rewritten is by no means necessary - it's just a flourish which exemplifies <code>sys.stdout.write()</code> versus <code>print()</code>. You could just as easily prime with a period and forget the three fancy backslash-b ⌫ backspaces (of course not writing formatted page counts as well) by just printing the period bar longer by one each time through - without spaces or newlines using just the <code>sys.stdout.write('.'); sys.stdout.flush()</code> pair.</p>
<p>Please note that the Raspberry Pi IDLE 3 Python shell does not honor the backspace as ⌫ rubout, but instead prints a space, creating an apparent list of fractions instead.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 31590081 Bala.K: </h3><p>You want to print something in the <em>for</em> loop right; but you don't want it print in new line every time...</p>

<pre><code> for i in range (0,5):
   print &quot;hi&quot;

 OUTPUT:
    hi
    hi
    hi
    hi
    hi
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>But you want it to print like this:
hi hi hi hi hi hi right????</p>
<p>Just add a comma after printing &quot;hi&quot;.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range (0,5):
    print &quot;hi&quot;,
</code></pre>
<p>OUTPUT:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>hi hi hi hi hi
</code></pre>
<h4> Comment 90795167 Cool Javelin: </h4>No, the OP wants hihihihihi, not hi hi hi hi hi<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 33901457 jarr: </h3><p>Many of these answers seem a little complicated. In Python 3.x you simply do this:</p>

<pre><code>print(&lt;expr&gt;, &lt;expr&gt;, ..., &lt;expr&gt;, end=" ")
</code></pre>

<p>The default value of end is <code>"\n"</code>. We are simply changing it to a space or you can also use <code>end=""</code> (no space) to do what <code>printf</code> normally does.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 42687762 Bikram Kumar: </h3><p>You will notice that all the above answers are correct. But I wanted to make a shortcut to always writing the &quot; end='' &quot; parameter in the end.</p>
<p>You could define a function like</p>
<pre><code>def Print(*args, sep='', end='', file=None, flush=False):
    print(*args, sep=sep, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)
</code></pre>
<p>It would accept all the number of parameters. Even it will accept all the other parameters, like file, flush, etc. and with the same name.</p>
<h4> Comment 83793336 Otzen: </h4>It do not run, it complaints that <code>*arg</code> is in beginning (python 2.7), and putting it at the end did run, but did not work completely right. I defined a function that only took <code>Print(*args)</code>, and then just called print with <code>sep=&#39;&#39;, end=&#39;&#39;</code>. And now it works as I want. So one upvote for the idea.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 62711015 Crystalline Core: </h3><pre><code> for i in range(0, 5): #setting the value of (i) in the range 0 to 5 
     print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>The above code gives the following output:</p>
<pre><code> 0    
 1
 2
 3
 4
</code></pre>
<p>But if you want to print all these output in a straight line then all you should do is add an attribute called    end() to print.</p>
<pre><code> for i in range(0, 5): #setting the value of (i) in the range 0 to 5 
     print(i, end=&quot; &quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code> 0 1 2 3 4
</code></pre>
<p>And not just a space, you can also add other endings for your output. For example,</p>
<pre><code> for i in range(0, 5): #setting the value of (i) in the range 0 to 5 
     print(i, end=&quot;, &quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
</code></pre>
<p>Remember:</p>
<pre><code> Note: The [for variable in range(int_1, int_2):] always prints till the variable is 1

 less than it's limit. (1 less than int_2)
</code></pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 52846176 U13-Forward: </h3><p>Or have a function like:</p>
<pre><code>def Print(s):
    return sys.stdout.write(str(s))
</code></pre>
<p>Then now:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10): # Or `xrange` for the Python 2 version
    Print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code>0123456789

</code></pre>
<p>This worked in both 2.7.8 &amp; 2.5.2 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthought" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Enthought Canopy</a> and OS X terminal, respectively) -- no module imports or time travel required.</p>
<h4> Comment 43905790 Keith Thompson: </h4>That prints backspace characters to standard output. It might <i>look</i> correct if standard output happens to be a terminal, but if it&#39;s redirected to a file that file will contain control characters.<br><h4> Comment 44020854 Keith Thompson: </h4>Nevertheless, the Python code does not do the same thing as the C code in the question.<br><h4> Comment 44020563 tyersome: </h4>True, but I can&#39;t imagine that anyone would want to use this for anything other than a low-tech progress bar ...<br><h4> Comment 98944156 fcm: </h4>you can test with <code>sys.stdout.isatty()</code> if not redirected to a file.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 76434047 ignacy: </h3><p>To print without ending a line, you can do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print(&quot;Hello&quot;, end='')
</code></pre>
<p>So if you add</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print(&quot; Hello again!&quot;, end='')
</code></pre>
<p>The output will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Hello Hello again!

</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print(&quot;.&quot; + &quot;.&quot; + &quot;.&quot; + &quot;.&quot;)

</code></pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 44015312 mchrgr2000: </h3><p>You do not need to import any library. Just use the delete character:</p>
<pre><code>BS = u'\0008' # The Unicode point for the &quot;delete&quot; character
for i in range(10):print(BS + &quot;.&quot;),
</code></pre>
<p>This removes the newline and the space (^_^)*.</p>
