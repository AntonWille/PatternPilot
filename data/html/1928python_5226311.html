 <h2> Title: Installing specific package version with pip </h2> <h4> Joe, question_id: 5226311 </h4>Score: 1928, Tags: {python,mysql,pip,pypi,mysql-python} <br><p>I am trying to install version 1.2.2 of <code>MySQL_python</code>, using a fresh virtualenv created with the <code>--no-site-packages</code> option. The current version shown in PyPi is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.3" rel="noreferrer">1.2.3</a>. Is there a way to install the older version? I have tried:</p>
<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>pip install MySQL_python==1.2.2
</code></pre>
<p>However, when installed, it still shows <code>MySQL_python-1.2.3-py2.6.egg-info</code> in the site packages. Is this a problem specific to this package, or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<pre><code>pip install 'stevedore&gt;=1.3.0,&lt;1.4.0'

<p>And if the package is already installed and you want to downgrade it add <code>--force-reinstall</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>pip install 'stevedore&gt;=1.3.0,&lt;1.4.0' --force-reinstall

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/968132/peter">@Peter</a> for highlighting this (and it seems that the context of the question has broadened given the time when the question was first asked!), <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-I" rel="noreferrer">the documentation for Python</a> discusses a caveat with using <code>-I</code>, in that it can break your installation if it was installed with a different package manager or if if your package is/was a different version.</p>
<hr />
<p>Original answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pip install -Iv</code> (i.e. <code>pip install -Iv MySQL_python==1.2.2</code>)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>What these options mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-I</code> stands for <code>--ignore-installed</code> which will ignore the installed packages, overwriting them.</li>
<li><code>-v</code> is for verbose. You can combine for even more verbosity (i.e. <code>-vv</code>) up to 3 times (e.g. <code>-Ivvv</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <code>pip install --help</code></p>
<p>First, I see two issues with what you're trying to do. Since you already have an installed version, you should either uninstall the current existing driver or use <code>pip install -I MySQL_python==1.2.2</code></p>
<p>However, you'll soon find out that this doesn't work. If you look at pip's installation log, or if you do a <code>pip install -Iv MySQL_python==1.2.2</code> you'll find that the PyPI URL link does not work for MySQL_python v1.2.2. You can verify this here: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.2" rel="noreferrer">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.2</a></p>
<p>The download link 404s and the fallback URL links are re-directing infinitely due to sourceforge.net's recent upgrade and PyPI's stale URL.</p>
<p>So to properly install the driver, you can follow these steps:</p>
<pre><code>pip uninstall MySQL_python
pip install -Iv http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/files/mysql-python/1.2.2/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz/download
</code></pre>

<pre><code>pip install -Iv MySQL_python==1.2.2

<p>i.e. Use <code>==</code> and mention the version number to install only that version. <code>-I, --ignore-installed</code> ignores already installed packages.</p>

<p>This command tells pip to install a version of the module lower than version 10. Do this in a <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage" rel="noreferrer">virutalenv</a> so you don't screw up your site installation of Python.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> 0x5453, Id: 54831043, Score: 9: </h3><p>I recently ran into an issue when using <code>pip</code>'s <code>-I</code> flag that I wanted to document somewhere:</p>

<p><code>-I</code> will <em>not</em> uninstall the existing package before proceeding; it will just install it on top of the old one.  This means that any files that should be deleted between versions will instead be left in place.  This can cause weird behavior if those files share names with other installed modules.</p>

<p>For example, let's say there's a package named <code>package</code>.  In one of <code>package</code>s files, they use <code>import datetime</code>.  Now, in <code>package@2.0.0</code>, this points to the standard library <code>datetime</code> module, but in <code>package@3.0.0</code>, they added a local <code>datetime.py</code> as a replacement for the standard library version (for whatever reason).  </p>

<p>Now lets say I run <code>pip install package==3.0.0</code>, but then later realize that I actually wanted version <code>2.0.0</code>.  If I now run <code>pip install -I package==2.0.0</code>, <strong>the old <code>datetime.py</code> file will not be removed, so any calls to <code>import datetime</code> will import the wrong module.</strong></p>

<p>In my case, this manifested with strange syntax errors because the newer version of the package added a file that was only compatible with Python 3, and when I downgraded package versions to support Python 2, I continued importing the Python-3-only module.</p>

<p>Based on this, I would argue that uninstalling the old package is always preferable to using <code>-I</code> when updating installed package versions.</p>

<strong>A). pip install -Iv package-name == version</strong>
<strong>B). pip install -v package-name == version</strong></p>

<p><strong>For A</strong></p>

<p>Here, if you're using -I option while installing(when you don't know if the package is already installed) (like 'pip install -Iv pyreadline == 2.* 'or something), you would be installing a new separate package with the same existing package having some different version.</p>

<p><strong>For B</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>At first, you may want to check for no broken requirements. 
<strong>pip check</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>2.and then see what's already installed by 
<strong>pip list</strong></p>

<p>3.if the list of the packages contain any package that you wish to install with specific version then the better option is to uninstall the package of this version first, by 
<strong>pip uninstall package-name</strong></p>

<p>4.And now you can go ahead to reinstall the same package with a specific version, by
<strong>pip install -v package-name==version</strong>
e.g. pip install -v pyreadline == 2.*</p>
