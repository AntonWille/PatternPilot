<p>executes a command and <em>never returns</em>.
  It's like a <code>return</code> statement in a function.</p>

<p>If the command is not found <code>exec</code> returns false.
  It never returns true, because if the command is found it never returns at all.
  There is also no point in returning <code>STDOUT</code>, <code>STDERR</code> or exit status of the command.
  You can find documentation about it in  <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/exec.html" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>perlfunc</code></strong></a>, 
  because it is a function.</p>

<h2><strong>system</strong></h2>

<p>executes a command and your Perl script is continued after the command has finished.</p>

<p>The return value is the exit status of the command.
  You can find documentation about it in  <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/system.html" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>perlfunc</code></strong></a>.</p>

<h2><strong>backticks</strong></h2>

<p>like <code>system</code> executes a command and your perl script is continued after the command has finished.</p>

<p>In contrary to <strong><code>system</code></strong> the return value is <code>STDOUT</code> of the command.
  <code>qx//</code> is equivalent to backticks.
  You can find documentation about it in <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-Like-Operators" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>perlop</code></strong></a>, because unlike <code>system</code> and <code>exec</code>it is an operator.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Other ways</strong></h2>

<p>What is missing from the above is a way to execute a command asynchronously.
That means your perl script and your command run simultaneously.
This can be accomplished with <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/open.html" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>open</code></strong></a>.
It allows you to read <code>STDOUT</code>/<code>STDERR</code> and write to <code>STDIN</code> of your command.
It is platform dependent though.</p>

<p>There are also several modules which can ease this tasks.
There is <code>IPC::Open2</code> and <code>IPC::Open3</code> and <code>IPC::Run</code>, as well as
<code>Win32::Process::Create</code> if you are on windows.</p>

<h2><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/system.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>system</code></a>: run a command and wait for it to return</h2>

<p>Use <code>system</code> when you want to run a command, don't care about its output, and don't want the Perl script to do anything until the command finishes.</p>

<pre><code>#doesn't spawn a shell, arguments are passed as they are
system("command", "arg1", "arg2", "arg3");
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#spawns a shell, arguments are interpreted by the shell, use only if you
#want the shell to do globbing (e.g. *.txt) for you or you want to redirect

<h2><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#qx/STRING/" rel="noreferrer"><code>qx//</code> or ``</a>: run a command and capture its STDOUT</h2>

<p>Use <code>qx//</code> when you want to run a command, capture what it writes to STDOUT, and don't want the Perl script to do anything until the command finishes.</p>

<pre><code>#arguments are always processed by the shell

#in list context it returns the output as a list of lines
my @lines = qx/command arg1 arg2 arg3/;

</code></pre>

<h2><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/exec.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>exec</code></a>: replace the current process with another process.</h2>

<p>Use <code>exec</code> along with <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/fork.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>fork</code></a> when you want to run a command, don't care about its output, and don't want to wait for it to return.  <code>system</code> is really just </p>

<h2><a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/open.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>open</code></a>: run a process and create a pipe to its STDIN or STDERR</h2>

<p>Use <code>open</code> when you want to write data to a process's STDIN or read data from a process's STDOUT (but not both at the same time).</p>

<pre><code>#read from a gzip file as if it were a normal file
open my $read_fh, "-|", "gzip", "-d", $filename
    or die "could not open $filename: $!";

#write to a gzip compressed file as if were a normal file

<pre><code>use IPC::Open2;

open2 my $out, my $in, "/usr/bin/bc"

<h2>Alternatives:</h2>

<p>In more complex scenarios, where you want to fetch STDOUT, STDERR or the return code, you can use well known standard modules like <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/IPC/Open2.html" rel="noreferrer">IPC::Open2</a> and <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/IPC/Open3.html" rel="noreferrer">IPC::Open3</a>.</p>

<pre><code>exec -&gt; exec "command"; ,
system -&gt; system("command"); and 
backticks -&gt; print `command`;
</code></pre>

<h2><code>exec</code></h2>

<p><code>exec</code> executes a command and never resumes the Perl script. It's to a script like a <code>return</code> statement is to a function.</p>

<p>If the command is not found, <code>exec</code> returns false. It never returns true, because if the command is found, it never returns at all. There is also no point in returning <code>STDOUT</code>, <code>STDERR</code> or exit status of the command. You can find documentation about it in <strong>perlfunc</strong>, because it is a function.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Need to start exec command";
my $data2 = exec('ls');
print "Now END exec command";
print "Hello $data2\n\n";
</code></pre>

<p>In above code, there are three <code>print</code> statements, but due to <code>exec</code> leaving the script, only the first print statement is executed. Also, the <code>exec</code> command output is not being assigned to any variable.</p>

<p>Here, only you're only getting the output of the first <code>print</code> statement and of executing the <code>ls</code> command on standard out.</p>

<h3><code>system</code></h3>

<p><code>system</code> executes a command and your Perl script is resumed after the command has finished. The return value is the exit status of the command. You can find documentation about it in <strong>perlfunc</strong>.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Need to start system command";
my $data2 = system('ls');
print "Now END system command";
print "Hello $data2\n\n";
</code></pre>

<p>In above code, there are three <code>print</code> statements. As the script is resumed after the <code>system</code> command, all three print statements are executed.</p>

<p>Also, the result of running <code>system</code> <em>is</em> assigned to <code>data2</code>, but the assigned value is <code>0</code> (the exit code from <code>ls</code>).</p>

<p>Here, you're getting the output of the first <code>print</code> statement, then that of the <code>ls</code> command, followed by the outputs of the final two <code>print</code> statements on standard out.</p>

<h3>backticks (<code>`</code>)</h3>

<p>Like <code>system</code>, enclosing a command in backticks executes that command and your Perl script is resumed after the command has finished. In contrast to <code>system</code>, the return value is <code>STDOUT</code> of the command. <code>qx//</code> is equivalent to backticks. You can find documentation about it in <strong>perlop</strong>, because unlike system and <code>exec</code>, it is an operator.</p>

<p>E.g.: </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Need to start backticks command";
my $data2 = `ls`;
print "Now END system command";
print "Hello $data2\n\n";
</code></pre>

<p>In above code, there are three <code>print</code> statements and all three are being executed. The output of <code>ls</code> is not going to standard out directly, but assigned to the variable <code>data2</code> and then printed by the final print statement.</p>
