<p>It's boilerplate code that protects users from accidentally invoking the script when they didn't intend to. Here are some common problems when the guard is omitted from a script:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you import the guardless script in another script (e.g. <code>import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guard</code>), then the latter script will trigger the former to run <em>at import time</em> and <em>using the second script's command line arguments</em>. This is almost always a mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have a custom class in the guardless script and save it to a pickle file, then unpickling it in another script will trigger an import of the guardless script, with the same problems outlined in the previous bullet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Long Answer</h1>
<p>To better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.</p>
<p>Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it sets a few special variables like <code>__name__</code>, and then</p>
</li>
<li><p>it executes all of the code found in the file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the <code>__name__</code> checks we always see in Python scripts.</p>
<h2>Code Sample</h2>
<p>Let's use a slightly different code sample to explore how imports and scripts work.  Suppose the following is in a file called <code>foo.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code># Suppose this is foo.py.

print(&quot;before import&quot;)
import math

print(&quot;before function_a&quot;)
def function_a():
    print(&quot;Function A&quot;)

print(&quot;before function_b&quot;)
def function_b():
    print(&quot;Function B {}&quot;.format(math.sqrt(100)))

print(&quot;before __name__ guard&quot;)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    function_a()
    function_b()
print(&quot;after __name__ guard&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Special Variables</h2>
<p>When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. In this case, we care about the <code>__name__</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>When Your Module Is the Main Program</strong></p>
<p>If you are running your module (the source file) as the main program, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>python foo.py
</code></pre>
<p>the interpreter will assign the hard-coded string <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> to the <code>__name__</code> variable, i.e.</p>
<pre><code># It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when run as the main program.
__name__ = &quot;__main__&quot; 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>When Your Module Is Imported By Another</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there's a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:</p>
<pre><code># Suppose this is in some other main program.
import foo
</code></pre>
<p>The interpreter will search for your <code>foo.py</code> file (along with searching for a few other variants), and prior to executing that module, it will assign the name <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> from the import statement to the <code>__name__</code> variable, i.e.</p>
<pre><code># It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when it's imported from another module.
__name__ = &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Executing the Module's Code</h2>
<p>After the special variables are set up, the interpreter executes all the code in the module, one statement at a time. You may want to open another window on the side with the code sample so you can follow along with this explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Always</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before import&quot;</code> (without quotes).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It loads the <code>math</code> module and assigns it to a variable called <code>math</code>. This is equivalent to replacing <code>import math</code> with the following (note that <code>__import__</code> is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code># Find and load a module given its string name, &quot;math&quot;,
# then assign it to a local variable called math.
math = __import__(&quot;math&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before function_a&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It executes the <code>def</code> block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called <code>function_a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before function_b&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It executes the second <code>def</code> block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called <code>function_b</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before __name__ guard&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only When Your Module Is the Main Program</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>If your module is the main program, then it will see that <code>__name__</code> was indeed set to <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> and it calls the two functions, printing the strings <code>&quot;Function A&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;Function B 10.0&quot;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only When Your Module Is Imported by Another</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>(<strong>instead</strong>) If your module is not the main program but was imported by another one, then <code>__name__</code> will be <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code>, not <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>, and it'll skip the body of the <code>if</code> statement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Always</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>It will print the string <code>&quot;after __name__ guard&quot;</code> in both situations.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em></p>
<p>In summary, here's what'd be printed in the two cases:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code># What gets printed if foo is the main program
before import
before function_a
before function_b
before __name__ guard
Function A
Function B 10.0
after __name__ guard
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code># What gets printed if foo is imported as a regular module
before import
before function_a
before function_b
before __name__ guard
after __name__ guard
</code></pre>
<h2>Why Does It Work This Way?</h2>
<p>You might naturally wonder why anybody would want this.  Well, sometimes you want to write a <code>.py</code> file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing <code>.py</code> files like your script and running special test functions. You don't want it to try running the script just because it's importing the module.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your module is mostly used as a main program, but it also provides a programmer-friendly API for advanced users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond those examples, it's elegant that running a script in Python is just setting up a few magic variables and importing the script. &quot;Running&quot; the script is a side effect of importing the script's module.</p>
<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Question: Can I have multiple <code>__name__</code> checking blocks?  Answer: it's strange to do so, but the language won't stop you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suppose the following is in <code>foo2.py</code>.  What happens if you say <code>python foo2.py</code> on the command-line? Why?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Suppose this is foo2.py.
import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)) # needed for some interpreters

def function_a():
    print(&quot;a1&quot;)

    function_b()

    function_a()
    print(&quot;m2&quot;)
print(&quot;t2&quot;)
      
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now, figure out what will happen in <code>foo3.py</code> (having removed the <code>__name__</code> check):</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>What will this do when used as a script?  When imported as a module?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Suppose this is in foo4.py
__name__ = &quot;__main__&quot;

<p>Why do we need this?</p>

<h2>Developing and Testing Your Code</h2>

<p>Say you're writing a Python script designed to be used as a module:</p>

<pre><code>def do_important():
    """This function does something very important"""
</code></pre>

<p>You <em>could</em> test the module by adding this call of the function to the bottom:</p>

<pre><code>do_important()
</code></pre>

<p>and running it (on a command prompt) with something like:</p>

<pre><code>~$ python important.py
</code></pre>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>However, if you want to import the module to another script:</p>

<pre><code>import important
</code></pre>

<p>On import, the <code>do_important</code> function would be called, so you'd probably comment out your function call, <code>do_important()</code>, at the bottom. </p>

<pre><code># do_important() # I must remember to uncomment to execute this!
</code></pre>

<p>And then you'll have to remember whether or not you've commented out your test function call. And this extra complexity would mean you're likely to forget, making your development process more troublesome.</p>

<h2>A Better Way</h2>

<p>The <code>__name__</code> variable points to the namespace wherever the Python interpreter happens to be at the moment. </p>

<p>Inside an imported module, it's the name of that module. </p>

    setup()
    foo = do_important()
    bar = do_even_more_important(foo)

<p>It will allow the module and its functions and classes to be imported into other scripts without running the <code>main</code> function, and will also allow the module (and its functions and classes) to be called when running from a different <code>'__main__'</code> module, i.e.</p>

<p>As the only special case, however, in whatever Python process you run, as in mycode.py:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this code actually doing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you execute <code>xy.py</code>, you <code>import ab</code>. The import statement runs the module immediately on import, so <code>ab</code>'s operations get executed before the remainder of <code>xy</code>'s. Once finished with <code>ab</code>, it continues with <code>xy</code>.</p>

<p>The interpreter keeps track of which scripts are running with <code>__name__</code>. When you run a script - no matter what you've named it - the interpreter calls it <code>"__main__"</code>, making it the master or 'home' script that gets returned to after running an external script.</p>

<p>Any other script that's called from this <code>"__main__"</code> script is assigned its filename as its <code>__name__</code> (e.g., <code>__name__ == "ab.py"</code>). Hence, the line <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> is the interpreter's test to determine if it's interpreting/parsing the 'home' script that was initially executed, or if it's temporarily peeking into another (external) script. This gives the programmer flexibility to have the script behave differently if it's executed directly vs. called externally.</p>

<p>Let's step through the above code to understand what's happening, focusing first on the unindented lines and the order they appear in the scripts. Remember that function - or <code>def</code> - blocks don't do anything by themselves until they're called. What the interpreter might say if mumbled to itself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open xy.py as the 'home' file; call it <code>"__main__"</code> in the <code>__name__</code> variable.</li>
<li>Import and open file with the <code>__name__ == "ab.py"</code>.</li>
<li>Oh, a function. I'll remember that.</li>
<li>Ok, function <code>a()</code>; I just learned that. Printing '<em>A function in ab file</em>'.</li>
<li>End of file; back to <code>"__main__"</code>!</li>
<li>Oh, a function. I'll remember that.</li>
<li>Another one.</li>
<li>Function <code>x()</code>; ok, printing '<em>peripheral task: might be useful in other projects</em>'.</li>
<li>What's this? An <code>if</code> statement. Well, the condition has been met (the variable <code>__name__</code> has been set to <code>"__main__"</code>), so I'll enter the <code>main()</code> function and print '<em>main function: this is where the action is</em>'.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom two lines mean: "If this is the <code>"__main__"</code> or 'home' script, execute the function called <code>main()</code>". That's why you'll see a <code>def main():</code> block up top, which contains the main flow of the script's functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why implement this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember what I said earlier about import statements? When you import a module it doesn't just 'recognize' it and wait for further instructions - it actually runs all the executable operations contained within the script. So, putting the meat of your script into the <code>main()</code> function effectively quarantines it, putting it in isolation so that it won't immediately run when imported by another script.</p>

<p>Again, there will be exceptions, but common practice is that <code>main()</code> doesn't usually get called externally. So you may be wondering one more thing: if we're not calling <code>main()</code>, why are we calling the script at all? It's because many people structure their scripts with standalone functions that are built to be run independent of the rest of the code in the file. They're then later called somewhere else in the body of the script. Which brings me to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the code works without it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that's right. These separate functions <strong>can</strong> be called from an in-line script that's not contained inside a <code>main()</code> function. If you're accustomed (as I am, in my early learning stages of programming) to building in-line scripts that do exactly what you need, and you'll try to figure it out again if you ever need that operation again ... well, you're not used to this kind of internal structure to your code, because it's more complicated to build and it's not as intuitive to read.</p>

<p>But that's a script that probably can't have its functions called externally, because if it did it would immediately start calculating and assigning variables. And chances are if you're trying to re-use a function, your new script is related closely enough to the old one that there will be conflicting variables.</p>

<p>In splitting out independent functions, you gain the ability to re-use your previous work by calling them into another script. For example, "example.py" might import "xy.py" and call <code>x()</code>, making use of the 'x' function from "xy.py". (Maybe it's capitalizing the third word of a given text string; creating a NumPy array from a list of numbers and squaring them; or detrending a 3D surface. The possibilities are limitless.)</p>

<p>Notice that when used in a package or module, <code>__name__</code> takes the name of the file.  The path of the actual module or package path is not given, but has its own DunderAlias <code>__file__</code>, that allows for this.</p>
<p>You should see that, where <code>__name__</code>, where it is the main file (or program) will <em>always</em> return <code>__main__</code>, and if it is a module/package, or anything that is running off some other Python script, will return the name of the file where it has originated from.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>Being a variable means that it's value <em>can</em> be overwritten (&quot;can&quot; does not mean &quot;should&quot;), overwriting the value of <code>__name__</code> will result in a lack of readability.  So do not do it, for any reason.  If you need a variable define a new variable.</p>
<p>It is always assumed that the value of <code>__name__</code> to be <code>__main__</code> or the name of the file.  Once again changing this default value will cause more confusion that it will do good, causing problems further down the line.</p>

<code>__main__</code> or the file name it has been imported from.</p>
<p>This means that if <code>__name__</code> is equal to <code>__main__</code> then the file must be the main file and must actually be running (or it is the interpreter), not a module or package imported into the script.</p>
<p>If indeed <code>__name__</code> does take the value of <code>__main__</code> then whatever is in that block of code will execute.</p>
<p>This tells us that if the file running is the main file (or you are running from the interpreter directly) then that condition must execute.  If it is a package then it should not, and the value will not be <code>__main__</code>.</p>

<p><code>__main__</code>: Like other programming languages, Python too has an execution entry point, i.e., main. <code>'__main__'</code> <em>is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes</em>. Basically you have two ways of using a Python module: Run it directly as a script, or import it. When a module is run as a script, its <code>__name__</code> is set to <code>__main__</code>.</p>

<p>Thus, the value of the <code>__name__</code> attribute is set to <code>__main__</code> when the module is run as the main program. Otherwise the value of <code>__name__</code>  is set to contain the name of the module.</p>

You can get their values anytime you want, so, let us focus on the <strong>__name__</strong> variable/attribute:</p>

<p>When Python loads a source code file, it executes all of the code found in it. (Note that it doesn't call all of the methods and functions defined in the file, but it does define them.)</p>

<p>Before the interpreter executes the source code file though, it defines a few special variables for that file; <strong>__name__</strong> is one of those special variables that Python automatically defines for each source code file.</p>

<p>If Python is loading this source code file as the main program (i.e. the file you run), then it sets the special <strong>__name__</strong> variable for this file to have a value <strong>"__main__"</strong>.</p>

<p>If this is being imported from another module, <strong>__name__</strong> will be set to that module's name.</p>

<p>So, in your example in part:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
   lock = thread.allocate_lock()
   thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 1", 2, lock))
   thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 2", 2, lock))

<p>means that the code block:</p>

<pre><code>lock = thread.allocate_lock()
thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 1", 2, lock))
thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 2", 2, lock))
</code></pre>

<p>will be executed only when you run the module directly; the code block will not execute if another module is calling/importing it because the value of <strong>__name__</strong> will not equal to "<strong>main</strong>" in that particular instance.</p>

<p>Hope this helps out.</p>

<p>In slightly different words, the <code>if __name__</code> guard is a mechanism for hiding code from other code. If you don't have a specific reason to hide something, don't: If you don't need to hide some code from <code>import</code>, don't put it behind this guard, and if you do, hide as little as possible.</p>
<p>In slightly more detail, let's say you have a simple script <code>fib.py</code> (adapted from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42773985/874188">this answer</a>):</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># XXX FIXME: useless (see below)

<p>Now, if you simply run <code>python fib.py</code> it works fine. But <code>__name__</code> will always be <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> in this scenario, so the condition is actually unnecessary. The script could be simplified to just</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>n = int(input('Write a number: '))
a, b = 0, 1
while b &lt; n:
    a, b = b, a+b
print('Fibonacci number %i: %i' % (n, b))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you still can't <code>import fib</code> with the new version, but if you didn't plan to do that in the first place, this version is actually better, because it's simpler and clearer.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> want to be able to <code>import fib</code>, the first version was useless, too, because the useful code was in a section which will not run when you <code>import</code> that file (in which case <code>__name__</code> will not be <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>). The proper design in that case would be to refactor the code so that the useful parts are in a function you can run when you want to after you have <code>import</code>ed it.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def main():
    n = int(input('Write a number: '))
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b &lt; n:
        a, b = b, a+b
    print('Fibonacci number %i: %i' % (n, b))

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you <code>import fib</code>, the call to <code>main()</code> will not be executed; but when you run <code>python fib.py</code>, it will.</p>
<p>Actually, a better design still would be to isolate the reusable part (the actual calculation) from the user-visible input/output:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def fibn(n: int) -&gt; int:
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b &lt; n:
        a, b = b, a+b
    return b

def main() -&gt; None:
    n = int(input('Write a number: '))
    print('Fibonacci number %i: %i' % (n, fibn(n)))

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can <code>from fib import fibn</code> and call the <code>fibn()</code> function from the code which performs this <code>import</code>.</p>
<p>(I called the function <code>fibn()</code> just to make it clearer what is what in this example. In real life, you might call it <code>fib()</code> and do <code>from fib import fib</code>.)</p>
<p>Notice the more modular and reusable design; the <code>fibn</code> function contains the actual calculation, but no user interface parts; and the pesky interactive I/O is separated out into the <code>main</code> function so that you can bypass it (or call it if you want to, of course).</p>
<p>Returning to the code in the question, I would similarly move the code from the <code>if</code> into a function as well, so that callers can invoke that function if they want to.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def main():
    lock = thread.allocate_lock()

<p>This changes the scope of the <code>lock</code> variable; if the surrounding code needs access to it, you will need to make it <code>global</code> (or, perhaps, better, refactor <code>main</code> to <code>return lock</code>, and have the caller capture the value in a local variable of its own).</p>
<p>(Unlike in languages like C, the name <code>main</code> has no specific meaning to Python; but it's a common convention to use it as the name of the thing which will be run. You still have to actually explicitly call it, like <code>main()</code>, unlike in C.)</p>

<p>In Python, <code>if__name__== &quot;__main__&quot;</code> allows you to run the Python files either as reusable modules or stand-alone programs.</p>
<p>When Python interpreter reads a source file, it will execute all the code found in it.
When Python runs the &quot;source file&quot; as the main program, it sets the special variable <code>__name__</code> to have a value <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>When you execute the main function, it will then read the <code>if</code> statement which checks whether <code>__name__</code> is equal to <code>__main__</code>.</p>

Here's an example of that:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def test_assert():
    assert 1 + 2 == 3

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    import pytest
    pytest.main([__file__])
</code></pre>
<p>Now your test will run regardless of calling it with <code>pytest</code> or <code>python</code>. Here's the <code>unittest</code> version:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import unittest

class Tests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_assert(self):
        self.assertTrue(1 + 2 == 3)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    unittest.main()
</code></pre>
<p>Then your script runs the same with a <code>python</code> call as it would with a <code>python -m unittest</code> call.</p>
<p>Now, what if you also want to make sure that all your args gets passed to <code>pytest</code> if called with <code>python</code>? Or, what if you also want to include additional args? Here's an example of how to do that:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def test_assert():
    assert 1 + 2 == 3

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    from pytest import main
    from sys import argv
    main([*argv, &quot;-s&quot;])
</code></pre>
<p>Now, your <code>python -v --html=report.html</code> will have the same effect as <code>pytest -v --html=report.html</code>, etc. It's a great way to make sure that scripts still run as intended, even if not run with the expected <code>pytest</code> or <code>python -m unittest</code> calls.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> PythonBeginner, Id: 76220303, Score: 1: </h3><p>Do the following in your project.</p>
<p>Make a python file and simply print the <code>__name__</code>.
Run this python file</p>
<p>Now, import this python file in another python file. Do not, touch the <code>__name__</code> print statement.</p>
<p>After importing, the <code>print(__name__)</code> will still execute.</p>
<p>First, the output will be <code>__main__</code>. But in the second scenario, the output will be different (according to the name of the python file).</p>
<p>Therefore, if you add an if check <code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;</code> it will return True if the python file is being run without importing as a standalone script. But if it is being imported, this will evaluate to False. Why would you need all this?</p>
<p>Maybe your python file is class based or function based. You might want to reuse these classes or functions in a different python file. But, you might not want to execute the python script which is to be executed when that python script is executed as a standalone script.</p>
<p>Therefore, make sure to add this in almost every python file.</p>
