 <h2> Title: Is there a &quot;do ... while&quot; loop in Ruby? </h2> <h4> Paige Ruten, question_id: 136793, created_at: 2008-09-25 23:15:03+00:00 </h4>Score: 487, Tags: {ruby,loops} <br><p>I'm using this code to let the user enter in names while the program stores them in an array until they enter an empty string (they must press enter after each name):</p>

Here &#39;if&#39; is a &#39;modifier&#39;:it is checked BEFORE,in order to determine whether executing the &#39;puts k&#39; statement.That&#39;s not the case of while/until loops that(when used as modifiers of a begin-end-block!),are evaluated AFTER the first execution.Maybe this caused the regretting,but have we something &#39;stronger&#39; than an old forum post,sort of an official deprecation like it uses to be in many other occasions?<h4> Comment by Xiong Chiamiov, Score: 3, Id: 96364829, created_at: 2019-02-20 18:54:53+00:00 </h4>@James As per the linked mail, he said he was &quot;regretting&quot; adding it.
