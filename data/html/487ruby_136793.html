 <h2> Title: Is there a &quot;do ... while&quot; loop in Ruby? </h2> <h3> Paige Ruten, question_id: 136793 </h3>Score: 487, Tags: {ruby,loops} <br><p>I'm using this code to let the user enter in names while the program stores them in an array until they enter an empty string (they must press enter after each name):</p>

<pre><code>people = []
info = 'a' # must fill variable with something, otherwise loop won't execute

while not info.empty?
    info = gets.chomp
    people += [Person.new(info)] if not info.empty?
end
</code></pre>

<p>This code would look much nicer in a do ... while loop:</p>

<pre><code>people = []

do
    info = gets.chomp
    people += [Person.new(info)] if not info.empty?
while not info.empty?
</code></pre>

<p>In this code I don't have to assign info to some random string.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this type of loop doesn't seem to exist in Ruby. Can anybody suggest a better way of doing this?</p>
<h4> Comment 29736199 Magne: </h4>I think the normal while loop looks nicer, and is easier to read.<br><h4> Comment 35946296 David Winiecki: </h4>@Jeremy Ruten is there any chance you would be interested in changing the accepted answer to Siwei Shen&#39;s answer, <code>loop do; ...; break if ...; end</code>?<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 10713963 Siwei: </h3><p><strong>CAUTION</strong>:</p>
<p>The <code>begin &lt;code&gt; end while &lt;condition&gt;</code> is rejected by Ruby's author Matz. Instead he suggests using <code>Kernel#loop</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>loop do 
  # some code here
  break if &lt;condition&gt;
end 
</code></pre>

<pre><code>|&gt; Don't use it please.  I'm regretting this feature, and I'd like to

|I'm surprised.  What do you regret about it?

Because it's hard for users to tell

  begin &lt;code&gt; end while &lt;cond&gt;

works differently from

  &lt;code&gt; while &lt;cond&gt;

<h4> Comment 18570309 Joshua Pinter: </h4>Spot on. This <code>begin end while</code> method didn&#39;t seem right. Thanks for giving me the fodder I needed to convince the rest of the team.<br><h4> Comment 43903336 AgostinoX: </h4>So,as far as I&#39;ve understood well,begin-end-while is &quot;regretted&quot; because violates the semantic of modifiers, that is:they are checked before executing the block, for example: puts k if !k.nil?. Here &#39;if&#39; is a &#39;modifier&#39;:it is checked BEFORE,in order to determine whether executing the &#39;puts k&#39; statement.That&#39;s not the case of while/until loops that(when used as modifiers of a begin-end-block!),are evaluated AFTER the first execution.Maybe this caused the regretting,but have we something &#39;stronger&#39; than an old forum post,sort of an official deprecation like it uses to be in many other occasions?<br><h4> Comment 56430776 Connor Clark: </h4>It took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure out why my use of this ruby &#39;do-while&#39; loop wasn&#39;t working. You should use &#39;unless&#39; to more closely mimic a c-style do-while, otherwise you may end up like me and forget to invert the condition :p<br><h4> Comment 96364829 Xiong Chiamiov: </h4>@James As per the linked mail, he said he was &quot;regretting&quot; adding it.  Sometimes people make mistakes, even if they&#39;re language designers.<br><h4> Comment 24672895 user1992284: </h4>It looks like the begin-end-while loop is actually evaluating the condition before running the loop.  The difference between that and a regular while loop is that it&#39;s guaranteed to run at least once.  It&#39;s just close enough to do...while to cause problems.<br><h4> Comment 129715764 equivalent8: </h4>also preferred in Ruby style guide <a href="https://github.com/rubocop/ruby-style-guide#loop-with-break" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/rubocop/ruby-style-guide#loop-with-break</a><br><h4> Comment 54634452 Rob: </h4>This is the explanation I was looking for when I wondered why there is a Rubocop check for this (Lint/Loop) <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/v0.34.2/lib/rubocop/cop/lint/loop.rb" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/v0.34.2/lib/rubocop/cop/lint&zwnj;&#8203;/&hellip;</a><br><h4> Comment 92148590 TheBritishAreComing: </h4>I don&#39;t understand, why would he add it to the language if he doesn&#39;t agree with its use?<br><h4> Comment 60560050 pablo: </h4>In my Ruby 2.2.3 &amp; 1.9.3 while condition is evaluated after running begin-end loop.

<p>I found the following snippet while reading the source for <code>Tempfile#initialize</code> in the Ruby core library:</p>
<pre><code>begin
  tmpname = File.join(tmpdir, make_tmpname(basename, n))
  lock = tmpname + '.lock'
  n += 1
end while @@cleanlist.include?(tmpname) or
  File.exist?(lock) or File.exist?(tmpname)
</code></pre>
<p>At first glance, I assumed the while modifier would be evaluated before the contents of begin...end, but that is not the case. Observe:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; begin
?&gt;   puts &quot;do {} while ()&quot; 
&gt;&gt; end while false
do {} while ()
=&gt; nil
</code></pre>
<p>As you would expect, the loop will continue to execute while the modifier is true.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; n = 3
=&gt; 3
&gt;&gt; begin
?&gt;   puts n
&gt;&gt;   n -= 1
&gt;&gt; end while n &gt; 0
3
2
1
=&gt; nil
</code></pre>
<p>While I would be happy to never see this idiom again, begin...end is quite powerful. The following is a common idiom to memoize a one-liner method with no params:</p>
<pre><code>def expensive
  @expensive ||= 2 + 2
end
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an ugly, but quick way to memoize something more complex:</p>
<pre><code>def expensive
  @expensive ||=
    begin
      n = 99
      buf = &quot;&quot; 
      begin
        buf &lt;&lt; &quot;#{n} bottles of beer on the wall\n&quot; 
        # ...
        n -= 1
      end while n &gt; 0
      buf &lt;&lt; &quot;no more bottles of beer&quot; 
    end
end

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 18495469 jds: </h3><p>From what I gather, Matz does not like the construct</p>

<pre><code>begin
    &lt;multiple_lines_of_code&gt;
end while &lt;cond&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>because, it's semantics is different than</p>

<pre><code>&lt;single_line_of_code&gt; while &lt;cond&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in that the first construct executes the code first before checking the condition,
and the second construct tests the condition first before it executes the code (if ever). I take it Matz prefers to keep the second construct because it matches one line construct of if statements.</p>

<p>I never liked the second construct even for if statements. In all other cases, the computer
executes code left-to-right (eg. || and &amp;&amp;) top-to-bottom. Humans read code left-to-right
top-to-bottom.</p>

<p>I suggest the following constructs instead:</p>

<pre><code>if &lt;cond&gt; then &lt;one_line_code&gt;      # matches case-when-then statement

while &lt;cond&gt; then &lt;one_line_code&gt;

&lt;one_line_code&gt; while &lt;cond&gt;

begin &lt;multiple_line_code&gt; end while &lt;cond&gt; # or something similar but left-to-right
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if those suggestions will parse with the rest of the language. But in any case
I prefere keeping left-to-right execution as well as language consistency.</p>
