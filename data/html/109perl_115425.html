If someone installs modules manually, it won't find them.  Also, if you have multiple people installing modules and the perllocal.pod is under source control, people might resolve conflicts incorrectly and corrupt the list (this has happened here at work, for example).</p>

<p>Regrettably, the solution appears to be walking through @INC with File::Find or something similar.  However, that doesn't just find the modules, it also finds related modules in a distribution.  For example, it would report TAP::Harness and TAP::Parser in addition to the actual distribution name of Test::Harness (assuming you have version 3 or above).  You could potentially match them up with distribution names and discard those names which don't match, but then you might be discarding locally built and installed modules.</p>

<p>I believe brian d foy's backpan indexing work is supposed to have code to hand it at .pm file and it will attempt to infer the distribution, but even this fails at times because what's in a package is not necessarily installed (see Devel::Cover::Inc for an example).</p>

<p>Also, you want to filter out duplicates in case previous Perl versions contain the same modules. The code to do this looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/perl -l

use strict;
use warnings;
use File::Find::Rule;

my %seen;
for my $path (@INC) {
    for my $file (File::Find::Rule-&gt;name('*.pm')-&gt;in($path)) {
        my $module = substr($file, length($path)+1);
        $module =~ s/.pm$//;
        $module =~ s{[\\/]}{::}g;
        print $module unless $seen{$module}++;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of the run, you also have all your module names as keys in the %seen hash. The code could be adapted to save the canonical filename (given in $file) as the value of the key instead of a count of times seen.</p>

<pre><code>perl perlmod.pl

<p>OR </p>

<pre><code>perl perlmod.pl &lt;module name&gt; #Case-insensitive(eg. perl perlmod.pl ftp)

<p>As of now the script skips the current directory('.') since I was having problems with recursing soft-links but you can include it by changing the grep function in line 17 from </p>

<pre><code>  grep { $_ !~ '^\.$' } @INC
