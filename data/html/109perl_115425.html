Great answer.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Ovid, Id: 115897, Score: 24: </h3><p>It's worth noting that perldoc perllocal will only report on modules installed via CPAN.  If someone installs modules manually, it won't find them.  Also, if you have multiple people installing modules and the perllocal.pod is under source control, people might resolve conflicts incorrectly and corrupt the list (this has happened here at work, for example).</p>

<p>Regrettably, the solution appears to be walking through @INC with File::Find or something similar.  However, that doesn't just find the modules, it also finds related modules in a distribution.  For example, it would report TAP::Harness and TAP::Parser in addition to the actual distribution name of Test::Harness (assuming you have version 3 or above).  You could potentially match them up with distribution names and discard those names which don't match, but then you might be discarding locally built and installed modules.</p>

<p>I believe brian d foy's backpan indexing work is supposed to have code to hand it at .pm file and it will attempt to infer the distribution, but even this fails at times because what's in a package is not necessarily installed (see Devel::Cover::Inc for an example).</p>

<pre><code>perl -MExtUtils::Installed -MData::Dumper -e  'my ($inst) = ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new(); print Dumper($inst-&gt;modules());'
</code></pre>

<p>Just make sure you have Data::Dumper installed.</p>
<h4> Paul Tomblin, Comment 16704805 Score: 2: </h4>This only lists about 15 perl modules, instead of the 5945 that &#39;cpan -l&#39; lists.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> mpersico, Id: 21918638, Score: 0: </h3><pre><code>cd /the/lib/dir/of/your/perl/installation
perldoc $(find . -name perllocal.pod)

<p>Windows users just do a Windows Explorer search to find it.</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Henrik, Id: 45776727, Score: -1: </h3><p>As you enter your Perl script you have all the installed modules as .pm files below the folders in @INC so a small bash script will do the job for you:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo -e -n "Content-type: text/plain\n\n"

inc=`perl -e '$, = "\n"; print @INC;'`

for d in $inc
do
   find $d -name '*.pm'
done

<h4> ROLO, Comment 85472557 Score: 1: </h4>the OP asked for a list of CPAN (perl) modules installed in the system, not if perl is installed in the system (neither the OP told us if apt is available)<br><h4> Yasiru G, Comment 85501521 Score: 0: </h4>I&#39;m not  a perl expert but I have seen installed perl modules from above command. May be not the perfect answer here.<br><h4> jjmerelo, Comment 115757212 Score: 0: </h4>@YasiruG it only lists those that have been installed via packages; that&#39;s a minority in any installation. Most of them are installed via CPAN.<br>
