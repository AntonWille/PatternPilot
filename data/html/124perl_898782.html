 <h2> Title: How do I tell CPAN to install all dependencies? </h2> <h4> Nifle, question_id: 898782, created_at: 2009-05-22 16:36:36+00:00 </h4>Score: 124, Tags: {perl,dependencies,cpan} <br><p>How do I tell CPAN to install all dependencies?</p>

<p>I tried setting these in <code>cpan</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cpan&gt; o conf prerequisites_policy follow
cpan&gt; o conf commit
</code></pre>

<p>I still had to answer "y" a couple of times (but fewer than before it feels like).</p>

<p>Is there a way to get it to always go ahead and install? I want to make it unattended. </p>

<p>It would seem that I want a flag to always trust CPAN to do the right thing, and if it suggests an answer I would like to follow it (always hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> when it asks something).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DESCRIPTION</p>
  
  <p>cpanminus is a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from
  CPAN and does nothing else. </p>
  
  <p>It's dependency free (can bootstrap
  itself), requires zero configuration, and stands alone. When running,
  it requires only 10MB of RAM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bootstrap install it:</p>

<pre><code>curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
</code></pre>

<p>or if you are using <a href="http://p3rl.org/App%3a%3aperlbrew"><code>perlbrew</code></a> simply</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew install-cpanm
</code></pre>

<p>or from cpan itself:</p>

<pre><code>cpan install App::cpanminus
</code></pre>

<p>From then on install modules by executing (as root if necessary)</p>

<pre><code>cpanm Foo::Bar
</code></pre>

while (&lt;&gt;) {
    if (/USE /i)

<p>This will use cpanminus to install all module dependencies required by your script. If cpanm isnt installed, it will install it.    </p>
