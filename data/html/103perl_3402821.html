 <h2> Title: In Perl, what is the difference between a .pm (Perl module) and .pl (Perl script) file? </h2> <h4> user380979, question_id: 3402821, created_at: 2010-08-04 05:20:56+00:00 </h4>Score: 103, Tags: {perl,perl-module} <br><p>What is the Difference between <code>.pm</code> (Perl module) and <code>.pl</code> (Perl script) file?</p>

<p>Please also tell me why we return <code>1</code> from file. If return 2 or anything else, it's not generating any error, so why do we return <code>1</code> from Perl module?</p>

It can be <code>2</code>, it can be <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code>, it can be <code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;list&quot;]</code>. What matters is it&#39;s not <code>0</code>, or anything else that evaluates as false, or <code>use</code> would fail.<h4> Comment by ikegami, Score: 0, Id: 129660273, created_at: 2022-08-19 19:41:10+00:00 </h4>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/6376006/589924">What is the difference between library files and modules?</a><h4> Comment by Remember Monica, Score: 0, Id: 54167754, created_at: 2015-10-16 22:08:26+00:00 </h4>.pl is actually a perl library - perl scripts, like C programs or programs written in other languages, do not have an ending, except on operating systems that need one to functiopn, such as windows.<hr><h3>  Answer by Sinan &#220;n&#252;r, Id: 3405551, Score: 87, created_at: 2010-08-04 12:41:09+00:00 </h3><p>At the very core, the file extension you use makes no difference as to how <code>perl</code> interprets those files.</p>
<p>However, putting modules in <code>.pm</code> files following a certain directory structure that follows the package name provides a convenience. So, if you have a module <code>Example::Plot::FourD</code> and you put it in a directory <code>Example/Plot/FourD.pm</code> in a path in your <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html#%40INC" rel="noreferrer"><code>@INC</code></a>, then <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/use.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>use</code></a> and <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/require.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>require</code></a> will do the right thing when given the package name as in <code>use Example::Plot::FourD</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The file must return true as the last statement to indicate successful execution of any initialization code, so it's customary to end such a file with <code>1;</code>  unless you're sure it'll return true otherwise. But it's better just to put the <code>1;</code>, in case you add more statements.</p>
<p>If <code>EXPR</code> is a bareword, the <code>require</code> assumes a &quot;.pm&quot; extension and replaces &quot;::&quot; with &quot;/&quot; in the filename for you, to make it easy to load standard modules. This form of loading of modules does not risk altering your namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All <code>use</code> does is to figure out the filename from the package name provided, <code>require</code> it in a <code>BEGIN</code> block and invoke <code>import</code> on the package. There is nothing preventing you from not using <code>use</code> but taking those steps manually.</p>
<p>For example, below I put the <code>Example::Plot::FourD</code> package in a file called <code>t.pl</code>, loaded it in a script in file <code>s.pl</code>.</p>
<pre><code>C:\Temp&gt; cat t.pl
package Example::Plot::FourD;

use strict; use warnings;

sub new { bless {} =&gt; shift }

sub something { print &quot;something\n&quot; }

&quot;Example::Plot::FourD&quot;

C:\Temp&gt; cat s.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict; use warnings;

BEGIN {
    require 't.pl';
}

my $p = Example::Plot::FourD-&gt;new;
$p-&gt;something;


C:\Temp&gt; s
something
</code></pre>
<p>This example shows that module files do not have to end in <code>1</code>, any true value will do.</p>

<p>In <code>.pm</code> (<a href="https://theworld.com/%7Eswmcd/steven/perl/module_mechanics.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Perl Module</a>) you have functions that you can use from other Perl scripts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Perl module is a self-contained piece of Perl code that can be used by a Perl program or by other Perl modules. It is conceptually similar to a C link library, or a C++ class.</p>

It&#39;s only on broken operating systems that you need to identify Perl programs with a .pl extension. And originally .pl indicated a &quot;Perl library&quot; - external subroutines that you loaded with a &quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot; command.
