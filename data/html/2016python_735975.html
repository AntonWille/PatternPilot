 <h2> Title: Static methods in Python? </h2> <h3> Joan Venge, question_id: 735975 </h3>Score: 2016, Tags: {python,static-methods} <br><p>Can I define a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)#Static_methods" rel="noreferrer">static method</a> which I can call directly on the class instance? e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>MyClass.the_static_method()
</code></pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 735978 dbr: </h3><p>Yep, using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod" rel="noreferrer" title="staticmethod"><code>staticmethod</code></a> decorator:</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass(object):
    @staticmethod
    def the_static_method(x):
        print(x)

MyClass.the_static_method(2)  # outputs 2
</code></pre>
<p>Note that some code might use the old method of defining a static method, using <code>staticmethod</code> as a function rather than a decorator. This should only be used if you have to support ancient versions of Python (2.2 and 2.3):</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass(object):
    def the_static_method(x):
        print(x)
    the_static_method = staticmethod(the_static_method)

MyClass.the_static_method(2)  # outputs 2
</code></pre>
<p>This is entirely identical to the first example (using <code>@staticmethod</code>), just not using the nice decorator syntax.</p>
<p>Finally, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod" rel="noreferrer" title="staticmethod"><code>staticmethod</code></a> sparingly! There are very few situations where static-methods are necessary in Python, and I've seen them used many times where a separate &quot;top-level&quot; function would have been clearer.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod" rel="noreferrer" title="staticmethod">The following is verbatim from the documentation:</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static method, use this idiom:</p>
<pre><code>class C:
    @staticmethod
    def f(arg1, arg2, ...): ...
</code></pre>
<p>The @staticmethod form is a function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator" rel="noreferrer" title="term-decorator"><em>decorator</em></a> â€“ see the description of function definitions in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function" rel="noreferrer" title="Function definitions"><em>Function definitions</em></a> for details.</p>
<p>It can be called either on the class (such as <code>C.f()</code>) or on an instance (such as <code>C().f()</code>). The instance is ignored except for its class.</p>
<p>Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. For a more advanced concept, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod" rel="noreferrer" title="classmethod"><code>classmethod()</code></a>.</p>
<p>For more information on static methods, consult the documentation on the standard type hierarchy in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types" rel="noreferrer" title="types"><em>The standard type hierarchy</em></a>.</p>
<p>New in version 2.2.</p>
<p>Changed in version 2.4: Function decorator syntax added.</p>

<h4> Comment 75253202 SomethingSomething: </h4>Why adding <code>@staticmethod</code> decoration or using a function pointer, when you can simply avoid the first <code>self</code> parameter? Well, for an object <code>a</code>, you won&#39;t be able to call <code>a.your_static_method()</code>, which is allowed in other languages, but it is anyway considered a bad practice and the compiler always warns about it<br><h4> Comment 91097004 George Moutsopoulos: </h4>@SomethingSomething, if you don&#39;t use the variable name &quot;self&quot;, but do not add the decorator, the first argument eg arg1 will still be the reference to the self instance. The name self is only a convention.<br><h4> Comment 111104054 IceFire: </h4>@SomethingSomething so many SO answers, blog posts, and references and NO ONE seems to answer this question. I completely agree with everything you said. One should neither write <code>self.staticMethod()</code> nor <code>instance.staticMethod()</code>. The only exception I found is when you use inheritance and want the staticMethod to be overridden, which seems to work in Python. Now calling <code>self.staticMethod()</code> acknowledges the class type of <code>self</code>... This might be interesting with factory methods or clones when needed within the class but is probably still rare<br><h4> Comment 91100082 SomethingSomething: </h4>@GeorgeMoutsopoulos - agreed generally. But - you will anyway be able to call the method as <code>ClassName.methodName()</code>, as if it was a static one, and then no <code>self</code>will be provided to the method. As you said, it will still be possible to also call this method as <code>ClassInstance.methodName()</code>, and <code>self</code> will be provided as the first parameter, regardless of its name.<br><h4> Comment 77488911 Supratim Samantray: </h4>I am using python 2.7.12, with @staticmethod decorator I am unable to call first static method defined. Its givin error : <b>TypeError: &#39;staticmethod&#39; object is not callable</b><br><h4> Comment 83731600 realslimshanky: </h4>Supratim Samantray, are you sure? because <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#staticmethod" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> it&#39;s clearly stated that it can be used after 2.4.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 10206355 Richard Ambler: </h3><p>I think that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/738102/3798217">Steven is actually right</a>. To answer the original question, then, in order to set up a class method, simply assume that the first argument is not going to be a calling instance, and then make sure that you only call the method from the class.</p>

<p>(Note that this answer refers to Python 3.x. In Python 2.x you'll get a <code>TypeError</code> for calling the method on the class itself.)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Dog:
    count = 0 # this is a class variable
    dogs = [] # this is a class variable

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name #self.name is an instance variable
        Dog.count += 1
        Dog.dogs.append(name)

    def bark(self, n): # this is an instance method
        print("{} says: {}".format(self.name, "woof! " * n))

    def rollCall(n): #this is implicitly a class method (see comments below)
        print("There are {} dogs.".format(Dog.count))
        if n &gt;= len(Dog.dogs) or n &lt; 0:
            print("They are:")
            for dog in Dog.dogs:
                print("  {}".format(dog))
        else:
            print("The dog indexed at {} is {}.".format(n, Dog.dogs[n]))

fido = Dog("Fido")
fido.bark(3)
Dog.rollCall(-1)
rex = Dog("Rex")
Dog.rollCall(0)
</code></pre>

<p>In this code, the "rollCall" method assumes that the first argument is not an instance (as it would be if it were called by an instance instead of a class). As long as "rollCall" is called from the class rather than an instance, the code will work fine. If we try to call "rollCall" from an instance, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>rex.rollCall(-1)
</code></pre>

<p>however, it would cause an exception to be raised because it would send two arguments: itself and -1, and "rollCall" is only defined to accept one argument.</p>

<p>Incidentally, rex.rollCall() would send the correct number of arguments, but would also cause an exception to be raised because now n would be representing a Dog instance (i.e., rex) when the function expects n to be numerical.</p>

<p>This is where the decoration comes in:
If we precede the "rollCall" method with</p>

<pre><code>@staticmethod
</code></pre>

<p>then, by explicitly stating that the method is static, we can even call it from an instance. Now, </p>

<pre><code>rex.rollCall(-1)
</code></pre>

<p>would work. The insertion of @staticmethod before a method definition, then, stops an instance from sending itself as an argument.</p>

<p>You can verify this by trying the following code with and without the @staticmethod line commented out.</p>

<pre><code>class Dog:
    count = 0 # this is a class variable
    dogs = [] # this is a class variable

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name #self.name is an instance variable
        Dog.count += 1
        Dog.dogs.append(name)

    def bark(self, n): # this is an instance method
        print("{} says: {}".format(self.name, "woof! " * n))

    @staticmethod
    def rollCall(n):
        print("There are {} dogs.".format(Dog.count))
        if n &gt;= len(Dog.dogs) or n &lt; 0:
            print("They are:")
            for dog in Dog.dogs:
                print("  {}".format(dog))
        else:
            print("The dog indexed at {} is {}.".format(n, Dog.dogs[n]))


fido = Dog("Fido")
fido.bark(3)
Dog.rollCall(-1)
rex = Dog("Rex")
Dog.rollCall(0)
rex.rollCall(-1)

<h4> Comment 21092047 tba: </h4>The first example (calling by class without @staticmethod) doesn&#39;t work for me on Python 2.7.

If you know a method is static, you should access it as a static method. The fact that the method does not need or use your instance should be self-evident wherever you use the method. I always use <code>T.my_static_method()</code> or <code>type(my_t_instance).my_static_method()</code>, since this is clearer and makes it immediately obvious that I&#39;m calling a static method.<br><h4> Comment 28689958 Mittenchops: </h4>This does not work.

<p>Mostly, you just use functions though...</p>
<h4> Comment 111208776 IceFire: </h4>@EthanFurman You stopped there where I started my question: Why would you call the static method from an instance object? Normally, you would not do this in most programming languages<br><h4> Comment 35601675 spinkus: </h4>Actually this is wrong in 2.7 and legal as of 3.X (tested fine in 3.2). That is you <i>can&#39;t</i> call a method from context of a class without the @staticmethod decorator in 2.7 and below. In 3.2 it works and will insert a <code>self</code> ref appropriately depending on how its called.

(see: decorator)<br><h4> Comment 111151652 Ethan Furman: </h4>@IceFire: a <code>staticmethod</code> is one which does not require any class nor instance data to do its function -- so the only reason to have it in a class at all is for convenience/packaging, and it would be very convenient for an instance to call such a utility method on itself.<br><h4> Comment 72046430 Ethan Furman: </h4>Technically accurate, but a terrible solution.  The <code>staticmethod</code> decorator allows one to call the function on both the class and an instance (this solution fails when calling the function on an instance).<br><h4> Comment 111552859 Ethan Furman: </h4>Let&#39;s say a class you are subclassing (<code>Main</code>) is in some library, and it has dependencies on other libraries (<code>utils.do_something</code>); the module with your subclass can either <code>import utils</code> to make sure your subclass has access to it (one more thing to keep track of) or <code>Main</code> can make that function a static method (<code>do_something = staticmethod(utils.do_something)</code> and then your subclass can easily access it with <code>self.do_something(...)</code> and life just got a little bit better.  :-)<br><h4> Comment 80753026 pouya: </h4>a method can be called like any other attribute of an object using dot notation.<code>class C: def callme(): print(&#39;called&#39;); C.callme()</code><br><h4> Comment 91097095 George Moutsopoulos: </h4>Please read Navin&#39;s comment.

  <p><strong>Static methods in Python?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Is it possible to have static methods in Python so I can call them
  without initializing a class, like:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName.StaticMethod()
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, static methods can be created like this (although it's a bit more <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">Pythonic</a> to use underscores instead of CamelCase for methods):</p>

<pre><code>class ClassName(object):

    @staticmethod
    def static_method(kwarg1=None):
        '''return a value that is a function of kwarg1'''
</code></pre>

<p>The above uses the decorator syntax. This syntax is equivalent to </p>

<pre><code>class ClassName(object):

    def static_method(kwarg1=None):
        '''return a value that is a function of kwarg1'''

    static_method = staticmethod(static_method)
</code></pre>

<p>This can be used just as you described:</p>

<pre><code>ClassName.static_method()
</code></pre>

<p>A builtin example of a static method is <code>str.maketrans()</code> in Python 3, which was a function in the <code>string</code> module in Python 2.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another option that can be used as you describe is the <code>classmethod</code>, the difference is that the classmethod gets the class as an implicit first argument, and if subclassed, then it gets the subclass as the implicit first argument.</p>

<pre><code>class ClassName(object):

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls, kwarg1=None):
        '''return a value that is a function of the class and kwarg1'''
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>cls</code> is not a required name for the first argument, but most experienced Python coders will consider it badly done if you use anything else.</p>

<p>These are typically used as alternative constructors. </p>

<pre><code>new_instance = ClassName.class_method()
</code></pre>

<p>A builtin example is <code>dict.fromkeys()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new_dict = dict.fromkeys(['key1', 'key2'])
</code></pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 25041766 Matt Woelk: </h3><p>Perhaps the simplest option is just to put those functions outside of the class:</p>

<pre><code>class Dog(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        if self.name == "Doggy":
            return barking_sound()
        else:
            return "yip yip"

def barking_sound():
    return "woof woof"
</code></pre>

<p>Using this method, functions which modify or use internal object state (have side effects) can be kept in the class, and the reusable utility functions can be moved outside.</p>

<p>Let's say this file is called <code>dogs.py</code>. To use these, you'd call <code>dogs.barking_sound()</code> instead of <code>dogs.Dog.barking_sound</code>.</p>

<p>If you really need a static method to be part of the class, you can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#staticmethod" rel="noreferrer">staticmethod</a> decorator.</p>
<h4> Comment 132195283 Alex: </h4>@help-ukraine-now It is perfectly fine to place functions outside the class, because Python has the concept of Modules to organize code. It can be even a bit faster, because it requires 1 less lookup. There isn&#39;t really a use-case for staticmethod in Python.<br><h4> Comment 127177855 help-ukraine-now: </h4>what&#39;s considered to be the best practice? because I prefer keeping functions outside of the class, but it might be more maintainable when you define static methods within classes?<br><h4> Comment 130716346 Zak: </h4>If the method has a valid generic use case where the class is not involved, I prefer it outside of the class, as just simple function. But I often have several methods which do similar things, but in different ways, according to what a certain class requires -- and then it makes a lot of sense to define them as static, inside their respective class, to avoid both name collisions and misunderstandings what a given method does. So I can have <code>class1.dothething()</code> and <code>class2.dothething()</code> provide similar functionality (e.g. preprocessing input), specific to what their class requires.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 14085311 Filip DupanoviÄ‡: </h3><p>Aside from the particularities of how <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#types" rel="noreferrer">static method objects</a> behave, there is a certain kind of beauty you can strike with them when it comes to organizing your module-level code.</p>

<p>It now becomes a bit more intuitive and self-documenting in which context certain components are meant to be used and it pans out ideally for naming distinct test cases as well as having a straightforward approach to how test modules map to actual modules under tests for purists.</p>

<p>I frequently find it viable to apply this approach to organizing a project's utility code. Quite often, people immediately rush and create a <code>utils</code> package and end up with 9 modules of which one has 120 LOC and the rest are two dozen LOC at best. I prefer to start with this and convert it to a package and create modules only for the beasts that truly deserve them:</p>

<pre><code># utils.py

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 56444932 Aman Raheja: </h3><p>So, static methods are the methods which can be called without creating the object of a class.
For Example :-</p>

<pre><code>    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

b = A.add(12,12)
print b
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example method <code>add</code> is called by the class name <code>A</code> not the object name.</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 53865415 Codemaker2015: </h3><p>Python Static methods can be created in two ways. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using staticmethod()</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Arithmetic:
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
# create add static method
Arithmetic.add = staticmethod(Arithmetic.add)

print('Result:', Arithmetic.add(15, 10))
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<p>Result: 25</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Using @staticmethod</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Arithmetic:

# create add static method
@staticmethod
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print('Result:', Arithmetic.add(15, 10))
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>jeffs@jeffs-desktop:/home/jeffs  $ python36
Python 3.6.1 (default, Sep  7 2017, 16:36:03) 
[GCC 6.3.0 20170406] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import cmath
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(cmath.sqrt(-4))
2j
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(cmath)
['__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atanh', 'cos', 'cosh', 'e', 'exp', 'inf', 'infj', 'isclose', 'isfinite', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'log', 'log10', 'nan', 'nanj', 'phase', 'pi', 'polar', 'rect', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'tau']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>It does not make sense to create an object of class cmath, because there is no state in a cmath object. However, cmath is a collection of methods that are all related in some way.  In my example above, all of the functions in cmath act on complex numbers in some way.</p>
