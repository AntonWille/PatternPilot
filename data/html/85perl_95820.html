 <h2> Title: In Perl, how do I create a hash whose keys come from a given array? </h2> <h4> raldi, question_id: 95820, created_at: 2008-09-18 19:08:09+00:00 </h4>Score: 85, Tags: {arrays,perl,hash} <br><p>Let's say I have an array, and I know I'm going to be doing a lot of "Does the array contain X?" checks.

<p>It's not as short as the "@hash{@array} = ..." solutions, but those ones require the hash and array to already be defined somewhere else, whereas this one can take an anonymous array and return an anonymous hash.</p>

<p>What this does is take each element in the array and pair it up with a "1". When this list of (key, 1, key, 1, key 1) pairs get assigned to a hash, the odd-numbered ones become the hash's keys, and the even-numbered ones become the respective values.</p>

<p>It's a hash slice, a list of values from the hash, so it gets the list-y @ in front.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldata.html#Slices" rel="noreferrer">the docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're confused about why you use
  an '@' there on a hash slice instead
  of a '%', think of it like this. The
  type of bracket (square or curly)
  governs whether it's an array or a
  hash being looked at. On the other
  hand, the leading symbol ('$' or '@')
  on the array or hash indicates whether
  you are getting back a singular value
  (a scalar) or a plural one (a list).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The syntax here where you are referring to the hash with an <code>@</code> is a hash slice.  We're basically saying <code>$hash{$keys[0]}</code> AND <code>$hash{$keys[1]}</code> AND <code>$hash{$keys[2]}</code> ... is a list on the left hand side of the =, an lvalue, and we're assigning to that list, which actually goes into the hash and sets the values for all the named keys.  In this case, I only specified one value, so that value goes into <code>$hash{$keys[0]}</code>, and the other hash entries all auto-vivify (come to life) with undefined values.  [My original suggestion here was set the expression = 1, which would've set that one key to 1 and the others to <code>undef</code>.  I changed it for consistency, but as we'll see below, the exact values do not matter.]</p>

<p>When you realize that the lvalue, the expression on the left hand side of the =, is a list built out of the hash, then it'll start to make some sense why we're using that <code>@</code>.  [Except I think this will change in Perl 6.]</p>

<p>The idea here is that you are using the hash as a set.  What matters is not the value I am assigning; it's just the existence of the keys.  So what you want to do is not something like:</p>

<pre><code>if ($hash{$key} == 1) # then key is in the hash
</code></pre>

<p>instead:</p>

<pre><code>if (exists $hash{$key}) # then key is in the set
</code></pre>

<p>It's actually more efficient to just run an <code>exists</code> check than to bother with the value in the hash, although to me the important thing here is just the concept that you are representing a set just with the keys of the hash.  Also, somebody pointed out that by using <code>undef</code> as the value here, we will consume less storage space than we would assigning a value.  (And also generate less confusion, as the value does not matter, and my solution would assign a value only to the first element in the hash and leave the others <code>undef</code>, and some other solutions are turning cartwheels to build an array of values to go into the hash; completely wasted effort).</p>

Efficiency depends on the scarce resource, often time but sometimes space and sometimes programmer effort. You are at least doubling the memory consumed by keeping a list and a hash of the list around simultaneously. Plus you're writing more original code that you'll need to test, document, etc.</p>
<p>As an alternative, look at the List::MoreUtils module, specifically the functions <code>any()</code>, <code>none()</code>, <code>true()</code> and <code>false()</code>. They all take a block as the conditional and a list as the argument, similar to <code>map()</code> and <code>grep()</code>:</p>
<p><code>print &quot;At least one value undefined&quot; if any { !defined($_) } @list;</code></p>
<p>I ran a quick test, loading in half of /usr/share/dict/words to an array (25000 words), then looking for eleven words selected from across the whole dictionary (every 5000th word) in the array, using both the array-to-hash method and the <code>any()</code> function from List::MoreUtils.</p>
<p>On Perl 5.8.8 built from source, the array-to-hash method runs almost 1100x faster than the <code>any()</code> method (1300x faster under Ubuntu 6.06's packaged Perl 5.8.7.)</p>
<p>That's not the full story however - the array-to-hash conversion takes about 0.04 seconds which in this case kills the time efficiency of array-to-hash method to 1.5x-2x faster than the <code>any()</code> method. Still good, but not nearly as stellar.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that the array-to-hash method is going to beat <code>any()</code> in most cases, but I'd feel a whole lot better if I had some more solid metrics (lots of test cases, decent statistical analyses, maybe some big-O algorithmic analysis of each method, etc.) Depending on your needs, List::MoreUtils may be a better solution; it's certainly more flexible and requires less coding. Remember, premature optimization is a sin... :)</p>
