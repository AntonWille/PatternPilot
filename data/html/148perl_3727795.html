------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> draegtun, Id: 3728027, Score: 161: </h3><p>An alternative method to using <code>upgrade</code> from the default CPAN shell is to use <a href="https://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanminus/lib/App/cpanminus.pm" rel="noreferrer"><code>cpanminus</code></a> and <a href="https://search.cpan.org/dist/App-cpanoutdated/bin/cpan-outdated" rel="noreferrer"><code>cpan-outdated</code></a>.</p>

<p>These are so easy and nimble to use that I hardly ever go back to CPAN shell. To upgrade all of your modules in one go, the command is:</p>

<pre><code>cpan-outdated -p | cpanm
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend you install <code>cpanminus</code> like the docs describe:</p>

<pre><code>curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
</code></pre>

<p>And then install <code>cpan-outdated</code> along with all other CPAN modules using <code>cpanm</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cpanm App::cpanoutdated
</code></pre>

<p>BTW: If you are using <code>perlbrew</code> then you will need to repeat this for every Perl you have installed under it.</p>

<p>You can find out more about <code>cpanminus</code> and <code>cpan-outdated</code> at the Github repos here:</p>

Afaict you can not <i>reliably</i> suppress this behavior with vanilla CPAN. This becomes important as soon as any kind of cron or CI server is involved, and/or if you like to be able to start an upgrade with the confidence it won&#39;t hang while you&#39;re out getting coffee (which in my experience is often the case with vanilla CPAN) See also this answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/898782/how-do-i-tell-cpan-to-install-all-dependencies" title="how do i tell cpan to install all dependencies">stackoverflow.com/questions/898782/&hellip;</a><br><h4> draegtun, Comment 37153478 Score: 4: </h4>Those are old (perl dates from 2006, LWP from 2005).  Ideally you need newer version of both.  If for some reason you can&#39;t do this then I would upgrade LWP version by version until you got cpanm|cpan-outdated working. NB. IMPORTANT - If you are using the CentOS installed Perl then don&#39;t use CPAN or CPANMINUS with these!  Never mix with OS packages!!  Instead use Perlbrew to brew your own perl (and then use cpanminus etc within this).<br><h4> Stephen Ostermiller, Comment 83942425 Score: 1: </h4>I like this solutions because you can easily run <code>cpan-outdated -p</code> first to see what it is going to do before actually running the upgrades.
