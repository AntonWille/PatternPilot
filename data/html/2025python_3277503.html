However, note that the <code>newline</code> argument of the <code>open</code> function is <code>None</code>, so universal newlines mode is enabled, and splitting on <code>&#39;\n&#39;</code> is valid in this case. Especially interesting, though, is that there is a <code>bytes.splitlines</code> method. This gives one the ability to emulate universal newlines mode when opening a file in binary mode. You do not actually need to open a file in text mode to easily split the file&#39;s data on line boundaries and can avoid importing the <code>re</code> module.<h4> Comment by wjandrea, Score: 1, Id: 125234488, created_at: 2022-01-24 20:36:29+00:00 </h4>Semantically, <a href="/a/24854173/4518341">you should use a list for this and not a tuple</a>.

<ul>
<li>Open the file</li>
<li>Read the file</li>
<li>Store the contents as list</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately Python makes it very easy to do these things so the shortest way to read a file into a list is:</p>

<pre><code>lst = list(open(filename))
</code></pre>

<p>However I'll add some more explanation.</p>

<h2>Opening the file</h2>

<p>I assume that you want to open a specific file and you don't deal directly with a file-handle (or a file-like-handle). The most commonly used function to open a file in Python is <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#open" rel="noreferrer"><code>open</code></a>, it takes one mandatory argument and two optional ones in Python 2.7:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filename</li>
<li>Mode</li>
<li>Buffering (I'll ignore this argument in this answer)</li>
</ul>

<p>The filename should be a string that represents the <em>path to the file</em>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>open('afile')   # opens the file named afile in the current working directory
open('adir/afile')            # relative path (relative to the current working directory)
open('C:/users/aname/afile')  # absolute path (windows)
open('/usr/local/afile')      # absolute path (linux)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the file extension needs to be specified. This is especially important for Windows users because file extensions like <code>.txt</code> or <code>.doc</code>, etc. are hidden <em>by default</em> when viewed in the explorer.</p>

<p>The second argument is the <code>mode</code>, it's <code>r</code> by default which means "read-only". That's exactly what you need in your case. </p>

<p>But in case you actually want to create a file and/or write to a file you'll need a different argument here. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30566011/5393381">There is an excellent answer if you want an overview</a>.</p>

<p>For reading a file you can omit the <code>mode</code> or pass it in explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>open(filename)
open(filename, 'r')
</code></pre>

<p>Both will open the file in read-only mode. In case you want to read in a binary file on Windows you need to use the mode <code>rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>open(filename, 'rb')
</code></pre>

<p>On other platforms the <code>'b'</code> (binary mode) is simply ignored.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now that I've shown how to <code>open</code> the file, let's talk about the fact that you always need to <code>close</code> it again. Otherwise it will keep an open file-handle to the file until the process exits (or Python garbages the file-handle). </p>

<p>While you could use:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(filename)
# ... do stuff with f
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>That will fail to close the file when something between <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> throws an exception. You could avoid that by using a <code>try</code> and <code>finally</code>:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(filename)
# nothing in between!
try:
    # do stuff with f
finally:
    f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>However Python provides context managers that have a prettier syntax (but for <code>open</code> it's almost identical to the <code>try</code> and <code>finally</code> above):</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    # do stuff with f
# The file is always closed after the with-scope ends.
</code></pre>

<p>The last approach is the <strong>recommended</strong> approach to open a file in Python!</p>

<h2>Reading the file</h2>

<p>Okay, you've opened the file, now how to read it? </p>

<p>The <code>open</code> function returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-file-objects" rel="noreferrer"><code>file</code></a> object and it supports Pythons iteration protocol. Each iteration will give you a line:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
</code></pre>

<p>This will print each line of the file. Note however that each line will contain a newline character <code>\n</code> at the end (you might want to check if your Python is built with <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-universal-newlines" rel="noreferrer">universal newlines support</a> - otherwise you could also have <code>\r\n</code> on Windows or <code>\r</code> on Mac as newlines). If you don't want that you can could simply remove the last character (or the last two characters on Windows):</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line[:-1])
</code></pre>

<p>But the last line doesn't necessarily has a trailing newline, so one shouldn't use that. One could check if it ends with a trailing newline and if so remove it:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.endswith('\n'):
            line = line[:-1]
        print(line)
</code></pre>

<p>But you could simply remove all whitespaces (including the <code>\n</code> character) from the <em>end of the string</em>, this will also remove all other <em>trailing</em> whitespaces so you have to be careful if these are important:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        print(f.rstrip())
</code></pre>

<p>However if the lines end with <code>\r\n</code> (Windows "newlines") that <code>.rstrip()</code> will also take care of the <code>\r</code>!</p>

<h2>Store the contents as list</h2>

<p>Now that you know how to open the file and read it, it's time to store the contents in a list. The simplest option would be to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="noreferrer"><code>list</code></a> function:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    lst = list(f)
</code></pre>

<p>In case you want to strip the trailing newlines you could use a list comprehension instead:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    lst = [line.rstrip() for line in f]
</code></pre>

<p>Or even simpler: The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.readlines" rel="noreferrer"><code>.readlines()</code></a> method of the <code>file</code> object by default returns a <code>list</code> of the lines:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    lst = f.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>This will also include the trailing newline characters, if you don't want them I would recommend the <code>[line.rstrip() for line in f]</code> approach because it avoids keeping two lists containing all the lines in memory.</p>

<p>There's an additional option to get the desired output, however it's rather "suboptimal": <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.read" rel="noreferrer"><code>read</code></a> the complete file in a string and then split on newlines:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    lst = f.read().split('\n')
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as f:
    lst = f.read().splitlines()
</code></pre>

<p>These take care of the trailing newlines automatically because the <code>split</code> character isn't included. However they are not ideal because you keep the file as string and as a list of lines in memory!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>with open(...) as f</code> when opening files because you don't need to take care of closing the file yourself and it closes the file even if some exception happens.</li>
<li><code>file</code> objects support the iteration protocol so reading a file line-by-line is as simple as <code>for line in the_file_object:</code>.</li>
<li>Always browse the documentation for the available functions/classes. Most of the time there's a perfect match for the task or at least one or two good ones. The obvious choice in this case would be <code>readlines()</code> but if you want to process the lines before storing them in the list I would recommend a simple list-comprehension.</li>

<hr>

<p>First and foremost, you should focus on opening your file and reading its contents in an efficient and pythonic way. Here is an example of the way I personally DO NOT prefer:</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>infile = open('my_file.txt', 'r')  # Open the file for reading.

data = infile.read()  # Read the contents of the file.

infile.close()  # Close the file since we're done using it.
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, I prefer the below method of opening files for both reading and writing as it
is very clean, and does not require an extra step of closing the file
once you are done using it. In the statement below, we're opening the file
for reading, and assigning it to the variable 'infile.'  Once the code within
this statement has finished running, the file will be automatically closed.</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code># Open the file for reading.
with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as infile:

    data = infile.read()  # Read the contents of the file into memory.
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to focus on bringing this data into a <strong>Python List</strong> because they are iterable, efficient, and flexible.  In your case, the desired goal is to bring each line of the text file into a separate element. To accomplish this, we will use the <strong>splitlines()</strong> method as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code># Return a list of the lines, breaking at line boundaries.
my_list = data.splitlines()

<li>pass <code>f</code> to a bound <code>list.extend</code> method</li>
<li>use <code>f</code> in a list comprehension</li>
</ul>

<p>I explain the use-case for each below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>In Python, how do I read a file line-by-line?</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an excellent question. First, let's create some sample data:</p>

<pre><code>from pathlib import Path
Path('filename').write_text('foo\nbar\nbaz')
</code></pre>

<p>File objects are lazy iterators, so just iterate over it.</p>

<pre><code>filename = 'filename'
with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        line # do something with the line
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you have multiple files, use <code>fileinput.input</code>, another lazy iterator. With just one file:</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput

for line in fileinput.input(filename): 
    line # process the line
</code></pre>

<p>or for multiple files, pass it a list of filenames:</p>

<pre><code>for line in fileinput.input([filename]*2): 
    line # process the line
</code></pre>

<p>Again, <code>f</code> and <code>fileinput.input</code> above both are/return lazy iterators.
You can only use an iterator one time, so to provide functional code while avoiding verbosity I'll use the slightly more terse <code>fileinput.input(filename)</code> where apropos from here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>In Python, how do I read a file line-by-line <strong>into a list?</strong></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah but you want it in a list for some reason? I'd avoid that if possible. But if you insist... just pass the result of <code>fileinput.input(filename)</code> to <code>list</code>:</p>

<pre><code>list(fileinput.input(filename))
</code></pre>

<p>Another direct answer is to call <code>f.readlines</code>, which returns the contents of the file (up to an optional <code>hint</code> number of characters, so you <em>could</em> break this up into multiple lists that way). </p>

<p>You can get to this file object two ways. One way is to pass the filename to the <code>open</code> builtin:</p>

<pre><code>filename = 'filename'

with open(filename) as f:
    f.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>or using the new Path object from the <code>pathlib</code> module (which I have become quite fond of, and will use from here on):</p>

<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

path = Path(filename)

with path.open() as f:
    f.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p><code>list</code> will also consume the file iterator and return a list - a quite direct method as well:</p>

<pre><code>with path.open() as f:
    list(f)
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't mind reading the entire text into memory as a single string before splitting it, you can do this as a one-liner with the <code>Path</code> object and the <code>splitlines()</code> string method. By default, <code>splitlines</code> removes the newlines:</p>

<pre><code>path.read_text().splitlines()
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to keep the newlines, pass <code>keepends=True</code>:</p>

<pre><code>path.read_text().splitlines(keepends=True)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to read the file line by line and append each line to the end of the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this is a bit silly to ask for, given that we've demonstrated the end result easily with several methods. But you might need to filter or operate on the lines as you make your list, so let's humor this request.</p>

<p>Using <code>list.append</code> would allow you to filter or operate on each line before you append it:</p>

<pre><code>line_list = []
for line in fileinput.input(filename):
    line_list.append(line)

line_list
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>list.extend</code> would be a bit more direct, and perhaps useful if you have a preexisting list:</p>

<pre><code>line_list = []
line_list.extend(fileinput.input(filename))
line_list
</code></pre>

<p>Or more idiomatically, we could instead use a list comprehension, and map and filter inside it if desirable:</p>

<pre><code>[line for line in fileinput.input(filename)]
</code></pre>

<p>Or even more directly, to close the circle, just pass it to list to create a new list directly without operating on the lines:</p>

<pre><code>list(fileinput.input(filename))
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>You've seen many ways to get lines from a file into a list, but I'd recommend you avoid materializing large quantities of data into a list and instead use Python's lazy iteration to process the data if possible.</p>

<p>That is, prefer <code>fileinput.input</code> or <code>with path.open() as f</code>.</p>
