<blockquote>
  <p><code>@_</code>: Within a subroutine the array <code>@_</code> contains the parameters passed to that subroutine.</p>

<p>More details can be found in <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html" rel="noreferrer">perldoc perlsub (Perl subroutines)</a> linked from the perlvar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any arguments passed in show up in the
  array <code>@_</code> . </p>
  
  <p>Therefore, if you called a function with two arguments, those
  would be stored in <code>$_[0]</code> and <code>$_[1]</code>.</p>
  
  <p>The array <code>@_</code> is a <strong>local array</strong>, but its
  elements are <strong>aliases for the actual scalar parameters</strong>. 
  In particular, if
  an element $_[0] is updated, the
  corresponding argument is updated (or
  an error occurs if it is not
  updatable). </p>
  
  <p>If an argument is an array
  or hash element which did not exist
  when the function was called, that
  element is created only when (and if)
  it is modified or a reference to it is
  taken. (Some earlier versions of Perl
  created the element whether or not the
  element was assigned to.) Assigning to
  the whole array @_ removes that
  aliasing, and does not update any
  arguments.</p>

<p>In a subroutine or when you call a function in Perl, you may pass the parameter list. In that case, <code>@_</code> is can be used to pass the parameter list to the function:</p>

<pre><code>sub Average{

    # Get total number of arguments passed.
    $n = scalar(@_);
    $sum = 0;

    foreach $item (@_){

        # foreach is like for loop... It will access every
        # array element by an iterator
        $sum += $item;
    }

    $average = $sum / $n;

    print "Average for the given numbers: $average\n";
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Function call</h1>

<pre><code>Average(10, 20, 30);
</code></pre>

<p>If you observe the above code, see the <code>foreach $item(@_)</code> line... Here it passes the input parameter.</p>

<p>Before call sub1 $size contain 1234. But after 500(!!) So you Don't edit this value!!! You may pass two or more values and change them in subroutine and all of them will be changed! I've never seen this effect described. Programs I've seen also leave @_ array readonly. And only that you may safely pass variable don't changed internal subroutine
You must always do that:</p>

<pre><code>sub sub2{
  my @m=@_;
  ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>assign @_ to local subroutine procedure variables and next worked with them.
Also in some deep recursive algorithms that returun array you may use this approach to reduce memory used for local vars. Only if return @_ array the same. </p>
