 <h2> Title: What is the proper way to check if a string is empty in Perl? </h2> <h4> Nick Bolton, question_id: 2045644 </h4>Score: 114, Tags: {perl,string,comparison} <br><p>I have been using this code to check if a string is empty:</p>
<pre><code>if ($str == &quot;&quot;)
{
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>And also the opposite with the not equals operator...</p>
<pre><code>if ($str != &quot;&quot;)
{
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This seems to work (I think), but I'm not sure it's the correct way, or if there are any unforeseen drawbacks. Something just doesn't feel right about it.</p>

<p>Anyways those are numeric operators, you should use </p>

<pre><code>if($foo eq "")
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>if(length($foo) == 0)
</code></pre>
<h4> Telemachus, Comment 1972936 Score: 5: </h4>It&#39;s true that Perl doesn&#39;t tend to advocate the &quot;one true way&quot; towards problem solving, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t strongly preferred idioms and styles and approaches. Also, as one of the Perl regulars likes to say a lot, even if there is more than one way to do things, <i>some</i> ways to do things are really, really bad (stupid, ill-advised, hard-to-maintain, etc.)<br><h4> Dave Sherohman, Comment 1975111 Score: 4: </h4>Just because there are many ways to do it does not mean that all ways are equal.  Testing for empty strings using <code>if ($foo == &quot;&quot;)</code>, for example, is <i>definitively wrong</i> unless you actually mean to be testing for whether <code>$foo</code>, evaluated in numeric context, has a value of 0 (in which case it would <i>still</i> be better written as <code>if ($foo == 0)</code>, as that more clearly expresses your intent).<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Greg Hewgill, Id: 2045663, Score: 154: </h3><p>For string comparisons in Perl, use <code>eq</code> or <code>ne</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if ($str eq "")
{
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators are <em>numeric</em> comparison operators. They will attempt to convert both operands to integers before comparing them.</p>

<h4> Evan Carroll, Comment 1972304 Score: 0: </h4>Yea, using this though you need to be cautious that if it is undef, and if you&#39;re using warnings you&#39;ll get a runtime warning. Many ways to get around the warning though.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> hobbs, Id: 2045818, Score: 111: </h3><ol>
<li><p>Due to the way that strings are stored in Perl, getting the length of a string is optimized.<br>
<code>if (length $str)</code> is a good way of checking that a string is non-empty.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're in a situation where you haven't already guarded against <code>undef</code>, then the catch-all for "non-empty" that won't warn is <code>if (defined $str and length $str)</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4> brian d foy, Comment 1975383 Score: 8: </h4>I think that length is the closest test that we have to the expression of the idea that there is nothing in the string.<br><h4> basic6, Comment 48738385 Score: 7: </h4>Upvoted because <code>if (length($str))</code> is a nice approach and doesn&#39;t fail if the variable is not defined.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> DmitryK, Id: 2045680, Score: 13: </h3><p>You probably want to use "eq" instead of "==". 
If you worry about some edge cases you may also want to check for undefined:</p>

<pre><code>if (not defined $str) {

# this variable is undefined

}
</code></pre>
<h4> Dacav, Comment 9947822 Score: 2: </h4>Very useful when you obtained the string by shifting of an array which may have 0 elements.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Matthew Slattery, Id: 2045704, Score: 9: </h3><p>As already mentioned by several people, <code>eq</code> is the right operator here.</p>

<p>If you <code>use warnings;</code> in your script, you'll get warnings about this (and many other useful things); I'd recommend <code>use strict;</code> as well.</p>

<h4> brian d foy, Comment 131951770 Score: 1: </h4>So, show us how that works with the string <code>0</code>. It&#39;s not that most answers are complicating things; it&#39;s that you never actually tried what you suggested to see all the ways it fails.<br>
