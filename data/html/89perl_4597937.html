You can read more about this on Jeffrey Friedl&#39;s Mastering Regular Expressions.

This post is talking about using a module in lieu of a fairly simple regex one-liner. If the module is core, I would be much more open to it. It is relevant in this case.<h4> Comment by Marki555, Score: 3, Id: 57268153, created_at: 2016-01-13 08:20:35+00:00 </h4>I know they are also from CPAN... Yes, generally I can request a new pkg for debian, but it won&#39;t help me for my installed debian stable release... that&#39;s why I prefer packages modules, but use directly CPAN if really needed.<h4> Comment by Marki555, Score: 3, Id: 57183046, created_at: 2016-01-11 10:01:16+00:00 </h4>why should everyone use modules from CPAN? It makes consistency difficult when using perl from your linux distribution (debian, redhat, ubuntu) combined with manually installed CPAN modules. It is much better if something can be done in perl using modules which are available as packages in linux distribution<h4> Comment by Erik Lievaart, Score: 1, Id: 103526600, created_at: 2019-10-29 12:58:43+00:00 </h4>I would prefer the possessive \s++ over \s+ It is slightly more efficient, because it does not use backtracking.

You can generally request a certain module to be packaged if it hasn&#39;t been done so already (the debian folks are particularly responsive and helpful).<h4> Comment by Ether, Score: 1, Id: 49541626, created_at: 2015-06-09 21:12:03+00:00 </h4>@mklement0 nor will it ever be.
