 <h2> Title: Why use strict and warnings? </h2> <h4> TLP, question_id: 8023959 </h4>Score: 111, Tags: {perl} <br><p>It seems to me that many of the questions in the Perl tag could be solved if people would use:</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
</code></pre>

<p>I think some people consider these to be akin to training wheels, or unnecessary complications, which is clearly not true, since even very skilled Perl programmers use them.</p>

<p>It seems as though most people who are proficient in Perl always use these two pragmas, whereas those who would benefit most from using them seldom do. So, I thought it would be a good idea to have a question to link to when encouraging people to <code>use strict</code> and <code>warnings</code>.</p>

<p>So, why should a Perl developer <code>use strict</code> and <code>warnings</code>?</p>

<p>While <code>use warnings;</code> will help you find typing mistakes in program like you missed a semicolon, you used 'elseif' and not 'elsif', you are using deprecated syntax or function, whatever like that. <strong>Note: use warnings will only provide warnings and continue execution, i.e., it won't abort the execution...</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, it would be better if we go into details, which I am specifying below</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/01/begperl6.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">perl.com</a> (my favourite):</p>
<p><strong>use strict 'vars';</strong></p>
<p>which means that you must always declare variables before you use them.</p>
<p>If you don't declare you will probably get an error message for the undeclared variable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global symbol &quot;$variablename&quot; requires explicit package name at scriptname.pl line 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This warning means Perl is not exactly clear about what the scope of the variable is. So you need to be explicit about your variables, which means either declaring them with <code>my</code>, so they are restricted to the current block, or referring to them with their fully qualified name (for ex: $MAIN::variablename).</p>
<p>So, a compile-time error is triggered if you attempt to access a variable that hasn't met at least one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Predefined by Perl itself, such as <em>@ARGV</em>, <em>%ENV</em>, and all the global punctuation variables such as <em>$</em>. Or <em>$_</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Declared with our (for a global) or my (for a lexical).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Imported from another package. (The <code>use vars</code> pragma fakes up an import, but use <code>our</code> instead.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fully qualified using its package name and the double-colon package separator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>use strict 'subs';</strong></p>
<p>Consider two programs</p>
<pre><code># prog 1
   $a = test_value;
   print &quot;First program: &quot;, $a, &quot;\n&quot;;
   sub test_value { return &quot;test passed&quot;; }
 Output: First program's result: test_value

# prog 2
   sub test_value { return &quot;test passed&quot;; }
   $a = test_value;
   print &quot;Second program: &quot;, $a, &quot;\n&quot;;
 Output: Second program's result: test passed
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases we have a test_value() sub and we want to put its result into $a. And yet, when we run the two programs, we get two different results:</p>
<p>In the first program, at the point we get to <code>$a = test_value;</code>, Perl doesn't know of any test_value() sub, and test_value is interpreted as string 'test_value'. In the second program, the definition of test_value() comes before the <code>$a = test_value;</code> line. Perl thinks test_value as sub call.</p>
<p>The technical term for isolated words like test_value that might be subs and might be strings depending on context, by the way, is <em>bareword</em>. Perl's handling of <a href="http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl/chapter_11.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">barewords</a> can be confusing, and it can cause bug in program.</p>
<p>The bug is what we encountered in our first program, Remember that Perl won't look forward to find <code>test_value()</code>, so since it hasn't already seen test_value(), it assumes that you want a string. So if you <code>use strict subs;</code>, it will cause this program to die with an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bareword &quot;test_value&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use at
./a6-strictsubs.pl line 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solution to this error would be</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use parentheses to make it clear you're calling a sub. If Perl sees $a = test_value();,</p>
</li>
<li><p>Declare your sub before you first use it</p>
<p>use strict;
sub test_value;  # Declares that there's a test_value() coming later ...
my $a = test_value;  # ...so Perl will know this line is okay.
.......
sub test_value { return &quot;test_passed&quot;; }</p>
</li>
<li><p>And If you mean to use it as a string, quote it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, This stricture makes Perl treat all barewords as syntax errors. <em>A <em>bareword</em> is any bare name or identifier that has no other interpretation forced by context. (Context is often forced by a nearby keyword or token, or by predeclaration of the word in question.)</em> So If you mean to use it as a string, quote it and If you mean to use it as a function call, predeclare it or use parentheses.</p>
<p>Barewords are dangerous because of this unpredictable behavior. <code>use strict; (or use strict 'subs';)</code> makes them predictable, because barewords that might cause strange behavior in the future will make your program die before they can wreak havoc</p>
<p>There's one place where it's OK to use barewords even when you've turned on strict subs: when you are assigning hash keys.</p>
<pre><code>$hash{sample} = 6;   # Same as $hash{'sample'} = 6
%other_hash = ( pie =&gt; 'apple' );
</code></pre>
<p>Barewords in hash keys are always interpreted as strings, so there is no ambiguity.</p>
<p><strong>use strict 'refs';</strong></p>
<p>This generates a run-time error if you use symbolic references, intentionally or otherwise.</p>
<p>A value that is not a hard reference is then treated as a <em>symbolic reference</em>. That is, the reference is interpreted as a string representing the name of a global variable.</p>
<pre><code>use strict 'refs';

$ref = \$foo;       # Store &quot;real&quot; (hard) reference.
print $$ref;        # Dereferencing is ok.

$ref = &quot;foo&quot;;       # Store name of global (package) variable.
print $$ref;        # WRONG, run-time error under strict refs.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>use warnings;</strong></p>
<p>This lexically scoped pragma permits flexible control over Perl's built-in warnings, both those emitted by the compiler as well as those from the run-time system.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perldiag.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>perldiag</code></a>:</p>
<p>So the majority of warning messages from the classifications below, i.e., W, D, and S can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(W) A warning (optional) <br />
(D) A deprecation (enabled by default) <br />
(S) A severe warning (enabled by default)</p>
