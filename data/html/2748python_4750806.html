<h2>Python 3 ≤ 3.3 and 2 ≤ 2.7.8</h2>
<p>Flying in the face of its <a href="http://www.python.org/about/" rel="noreferrer">'batteries included'</a> motto, Python ships without a package manager. To make matters worse, Pip was—until recently—ironically difficult to install.</p>
<h3>Official instructions</h3>
<p>Per <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip" rel="noreferrer">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip</a>:</p>
<p>Download <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" rel="noreferrer"><code>get-pip.py</code></a>, being careful to save it as a <code>.py</code> file rather than <code>.txt</code>. Then, run it from the command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>python get-pip.py
</code></pre>
<p>You possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow <em><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813(v=ws.10).aspx" rel="noreferrer">Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator</a></em> (Microsoft TechNet).</p>
<p>This installs the pip package, which (in Windows) contains ...\Scripts\pip.exe that path must be in PATH environment variable to use pip from the command line (see the second part of 'Alternative Instructions' for adding it to your PATH,</p>
<h3>Alternative instructions</h3>
<p>The official documentation tells users to install Pip and each of its dependencies from source. That's tedious for the experienced and prohibitively difficult for newbies.</p>
<p>For our sake, Christoph Gohlke prepares Windows installers (<code>.msi</code>) for popular Python packages. He builds installers for all Python versions, both 32 and 64 bit. You need to:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/%7Egohlke/pythonlibs/#setuptools" rel="noreferrer">Install setuptools</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/%7Egohlke/pythonlibs/#pip" rel="noreferrer">Install pip</a></li>
</ol>
<p>For me, this installed Pip at <code>C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe</code>. Find <code>pip.exe</code> on your computer, then add its folder (for example, <code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code>) to your path (Start / Edit environment variables). Now you should be able to run <code>pip</code> from the command line. Try installing a package:</p>
<pre><code>pip install httpie
</code></pre>
<p>There you go (hopefully)! Solutions for common problems are given below:</p>
<h3>Proxy problems</h3>
<p>If you work in an office, you might be behind an HTTP proxy. If so, set the environment variables <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code></a>. Most Python applications (and other free software) respect these. Example syntax:</p>
<pre><code>http://proxy_url:port
http://username:password@proxy_url:port
</code></pre>
<p>If you're really unlucky, your proxy might be a Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT_LAN_Manager" rel="noreferrer">NTLM</a> proxy. Free software can't cope. The only solution is to install a free software friendly proxy that forwards to the nasty proxy. <a href="http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/" rel="noreferrer">http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<h3>Unable to find vcvarsall.bat</h3>
<p>Python modules can be partly written in C or C++. Pip tries to compile from source. If you don't have a C/C++ compiler installed and configured, you'll see this cryptic error message.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You can fix that by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2817869/error-unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat">installing a C++ compiler</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW" rel="noreferrer">MinGW</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions" rel="noreferrer">Visual C++</a>.

<li>copy the uncompressed pip folder <strong>content</strong> into <code>C:\Python2x\</code> folder (don't copy the whole folder into it, just the content), because python command doesn't work outside <code>C:\Python2x</code> folder and then run:  <code>python setup.py install</code></li>

<p>1) If you have installed Python 3.4 or later, pip is included with Python and should already be working on your system.</p>

<p>2) If you are running a version below Python 3.4 or if pip was not installed with Python 3.4 for some reason, then you'd probably use pip's official installation script <code>get-pip.py</code>.

<pre><code>python get-pip.py
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>To upgrade an existing setuptools (or distribute), run <code>pip install -U setuptools</code></p>

<p>I'll leave the two sets of old instructions below for posterity.</p>

<p><strong>OLD Answers:</strong></p>

<p>For Windows editions of the <strong>64 bit</strong> variety - 64-bit Windows + Python used to require a separate installation method due to ez_setup, but I've tested the new distribute method on 64-bit Windows running 32-bit Python and 64-bit Python, and you can now use the same method for all versions of Windows/Python 2.7X:</p>

<p><strong>OLD Method 2</strong> using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute" rel="noreferrer">distribute</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py" rel="noreferrer">distribute</a> - I threw mine in <code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code> (feel free to create a <code>Scripts</code> directory if it doesn't exist.</li>
<li>Open up a command prompt (on Windows you should check out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/" rel="noreferrer">conemu2</a> if you don't use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell" rel="noreferrer">PowerShell</a>) and change (<code>cd</code>) to the directory you've downloaded <code>distribute_setup.py</code> to.</li>
<li>Run distribute_setup: <code>python distribute_setup.py</code> (This will not work if your python installation directory is not added to your path - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6318188/705198">go here for help</a>)</li>
<li>Change the current directory to the <code>Scripts</code> directory for your Python installation (<code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code>) or add that directory, as well as the Python base installation directory to your %PATH% environment variable.</li>
<li>Install pip using the newly installed setuptools: <code>easy_install pip</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The last step will not work unless you're either in the directory <code>easy_install.exe</code> is located in (C:\Python27\Scripts would be the default for Python 2.7), or you have that directory added to your path.</p>

<p><strong>OLD Method 1</strong> using ez_setup:</p>

<p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#windows" rel="noreferrer">from the setuptools page</a> --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Download <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py" rel="noreferrer">ez_setup.py</a> and run it; it will download the appropriate .egg file and install it for you. (Currently, the provided .exe installer does not support 64-bit versions of Python for Windows, due to a distutils installer compatibility issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After this, you may continue with:</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Add <code>c:\Python2x\Scripts</code> to the Windows path (replace the <code>x</code> in <code>Python2x</code> with the actual version number you have installed)</li>
<li>Open a new (!) DOS prompt. From there run <code>easy_install pip</code></li>
</ol>

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Maximiliano Rios, Id: 20948833, Score: 10: </h3><p>I had some issues installing in different ways when I followed instructions here. I think it's very tricky to install in every Windows environment in the same way. In my case I need Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 in the same machine for different purposes so that's why I think there're more problems.
But the following instructions worked perfectly for me, so might be depending on your environment you should try this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/" rel="noreferrer">http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/</a></p>

<p>Also, due to the different environments I found incredible useful to use Virtual Environments, I had websites that use different libraries and it's much better to encapsulate them into a single folder, check out the instructions, briefly if PIP is installed you just install VirtualEnv:</p>

<pre><code>pip install virtualenv
</code></pre>

<p>Into the folder you have all your files run</p>

<pre><code>virtualenv venv
</code></pre>

<p>And seconds later you have a virtual environment with everything in venv folder, to activate it run venv/Scripts/activate.bat (deactivate the environment is easy, use deactivate.bat). Every library you install will end up in venv\Lib\site-packages and it's easy to move your whole environment somewhere.</p>

<p>The only downside I found is some code editors can't recognize this kind of environments, and you will see warnings in your code because imported libraries are not found. Of course there're tricky ways to do it but it would be nice editors keep in mind Virtual Environments are very normal nowadays.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>For example, to install the <code>requests</code> package using pip, run this from cmd:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests

<p>Whola! <code>requests</code> will be successfully installed and you will get a success message.</p>

<p>Running of pip will sometimes require native compilation of a module (64-bit NumPy is a common example of that). In order for pip's compilation to succeed, you need Python which was compiled with the same version of Microsoft Visual C++ as the one pip is using.</p>
<p>Standard Python distributions are compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. You can install an Express version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, but it is not maintained. Your best bet is to get an express version of a later Microsoft Visual C++ and compile Python. Then PIP and Python will be using the same Microsoft Visual C++ version.</p>
