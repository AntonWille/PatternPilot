 <h2> Title: How do I print to stderr in Python? </h2> <h3> wim, question_id: 5574702 </h3>Score: 1747, Tags: {python,printing,stderr} <br><p>There are several ways to write to stderr:</p>
<pre><code>print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, &quot;spam&quot;  # Python 2 only.

sys.stderr.write(&quot;spam\n&quot;)

os.write(2, b&quot;spam\n&quot;)

from __future__ import print_function
print(&quot;spam&quot;, file=sys.stderr)
</code></pre>
<p>What are the differences between these methods? Which method should be preferred?</p>
<h4> Comment 8303220 Jessica: </h4>The first way listed is one of the many things removed in Python 3. The consensus seems to be that the &gt;&gt; syntax was ugly anyway, and since print is now a function, the syntax would never work.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 41304513 slushy: </h3><p>Nobody's mentioned <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/logging.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>logging</code></a> yet, but logging was created specifically to communicate error messages. Basic configuration will set up a stream handler writing to stderr.</p>

<p>This script:</p>

<pre><code># foo.py
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format='%(message)s')
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
log.warning('I print to stderr by default')
print('hello world')
</code></pre>

<p>has the following result when run on the command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 foo.py &gt; bar.txt
I print to stderr by default
</code></pre>

<p>and <em>bar.txt</em> will contain the 'hello world' printed on stdout.</p>
<h4> Comment 86069180 Mnebuerquo: </h4>In my experience, more people use print to log messages than use logging. I think python4 should just remove print from the language and force you to use logging for that.<br><h4> Comment 100507146 Carlos Saltos: </h4>This is the best answer !! ... I was struggling with print or sys or who knows ... when a proper logging is needed ... thanks for the good idea<br><h4> Comment 115683510 creallf: </h4>@Mnebuerquo Java does that... And now we have Kotlin.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 14981125 MarcH: </h3><p>I found this to be the only one short, flexible, portable and readable:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

def eprint(*args, **kwargs):
    print(*args, file=sys.stderr, **kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>The optional function <code>eprint</code> saves some repetition. It can be used in the same way as the standard <code>print</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Test&quot;)
Test
&gt;&gt;&gt; eprint(&quot;Test&quot;)
Test
&gt;&gt;&gt; eprint(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, sep=&quot;---&quot;)
foo---bar---baz

So that is a slight strike against this method, IMO.<br><h4> Comment 42603878 Dan H: </h4>@MarkH... yes, it forces you to make your code Python3-ready... it also forces you to do it NOW, just to print some debugging info to the stderr... which I would find more of a hassle in most situations when I&#39;m trying to debug something.

<h4> Comment 31243910 Rebs: </h4>I was going to suggest that you could use a partial too, but realised that partial assigns the stderr to the function at the creation time of the partial.

<p>Using partial only saves you 1 line of code. The potential confusion is not worth saving 1 line of code.</p>

<p><strong>original</strong></p>

<p>To make it even easier, here's a version that uses 'partial', which is a big help in wrapping functions.</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
import sys
from functools import partial

error = partial(print, file=sys.stderr)
</code></pre>

<p>You then use it like so</p>

<pre><code>error('An error occured!')
</code></pre>

<p>You can check that it's printing to stderr and not stdout by doing the following (over-riding code from <a href="http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com.au/2009/05/python-redirect-or-turn-off-stdout-and.html" rel="noreferrer">http://coreygoldberg.blogspot.com.au/2009/05/python-redirect-or-turn-off-stdout-and.html</a>):</p>

<pre><code># over-ride stderr to prove that this function works.
class NullDevice():
    def write(self, s):
        pass
sys.stderr = NullDevice()

# we must import print error AFTER we've removed the null device because
# it has been assigned and will not be re-evaluated.
# assume error function is in print_error.py
from print_error import error

# no message should be printed
error("You won't see this error!")
</code></pre>

<p>The downside to this is partial <strong>assigns</strong> the value of sys.stderr to the wrapped function at the time of creation. Which means, <strong>if you redirect stderr later it won't affect this function.</strong>
If you plan to redirect stderr, then use the **kwargs method mentioned by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20830343/1591957">aaguirre</a> on this page.</p>

<p>As stated in the other answers, <em>print</em> offers a pretty interface that is often more convenient (e.g. for printing debug information), while <em>write</em> is faster and can also be more convenient when you have to format the output exactly in certain way.

  <p>Answer to the question is : There are different way to print stderr in python but that depends on
  1.) which python version we are using
  2.) what exact output we want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The differnce between print and stderr's write function:
<strong>stderr</strong> : stderr (standard error) is pipe that is built into every UNIX/Linux system, when your program crashes and prints out debugging information (like a traceback in Python), it goes to the stderr pipe.</p>

<p><strong>print</strong>: print is a wrapper that formats the inputs (the input is the space between argument and the newline at the end) and it then calls the write function of a given object, the given object by default is sys.stdout, but we can pass a file i.e we can print the input in a file also.</p>

<p>Python2:
If we are using python2 then</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys

<blockquote>
  <p>Python2 trailing comma has in Python3 become a parameter, so if we use
  trailing commas to avoid the newline after a print, this will in
  Python3 look like print('Text to print', end=' ') which is a syntax
  error under Python2.</p>

  <p>If we check same above sceario in python3:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("hi")
hi
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under Python 2.6 there is a <strong>future</strong> import to make print into a
  function. So to avoid any syntax errors and other differences we
  should start any file where we use print() with from <strong>future</strong> import
  print_function. The <strong>future</strong> import only works under Python 2.6 and
  later, so for Python 2.5 and earlier you have two options. You can
  either convert the more complex print to something simpler, or you can
  use a separate print function that works under both Python2 and
  Python3.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import print_function
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; def printex(*args, **kwargs):
...     print(*args, file=sys.stderr, **kwargs)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; printex("hii")
hii
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Case: Point to be noted that sys.stderr.write() or sys.stdout.write()
  ( stdout (standard output) is a pipe that is built into every
  UNIX/Linux system) is not a replacement for print, but yes we can use
  it as a alternative in some case. Print is a wrapper which wraps the
  input with space and newline at the end and uses the write function to
  write. This is the reason  sys.stderr.write() is faster.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> we can also trace and debugg using Logging</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>#test.py
import logging
logging.info('This is the existing protocol.')
FORMAT = "%(asctime)-15s %(clientip)s %(user)-8s %(message)s"
logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT)
d = {'clientip': '192.168.0.1', 'user': 'fbloggs'}
logging.warning("Protocol problem: %s", "connection reset", extra=d)

<pre><code>message = 'error: Belly up!!'
print(message, file=sys.stderr if 'error' in message.lower() else sys.stdout)
</code></pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 73697035 David Bakare: </h3><p>Another way</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print(&quot;{}&quot;.format(sys.exec_info()[1], file=sys.stderr)
