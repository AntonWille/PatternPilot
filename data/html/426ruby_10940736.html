 <h2> Title: rbenv not changing ruby version </h2> <h3> ajorgensen, question_id: 10940736 </h3>Score: 426, Tags: {ruby,rbenv} <br><p>I installed rbenv according to the github directions. I am running OSX but I have tried this on a Ubuntu 12.04 VM and got the same results. The following is what i get in my terminal when I try to change ruby versions:</p>

<pre><code>rbenv versions
* 1.9.3-p0 (set by /Users/user/.rbenv/version)
1.9.3-p125

rbenv global
1.9.3-p0

rbenv rehash

ruby -v
ruby 1.8.7 (2011-12-28 patchlevel 357) [universal-darwin11.0]

which ruby
/usr/bin/ruby
</code></pre>

<p>Anyone have any ideas as to why rbenv isn't switching the ruby version like it thinks it is? Also there is no .rbenv file in the local directory that would be causing the ruby version to default to 1.8.7</p>

<pre><code>rbenv local
rbenv: no local version configured for this directory
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ env | grep PATH
</code></pre>
<p>Also check that you have the following in your ~/.bash_profile if using bash or ~/.zshenv if using zsh</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=&quot;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH&quot;
eval &quot;$(rbenv init -)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE:
Make sure it's the last setting in your ~/.bash_profile . I ran into an issue where I installed a program that updated my .bash_profile and reset PATH.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure your <code>$HOME</code> folder doesn't have a <code>.ruby-version</code> file that you may have created by accident if you were to have done <code>$ rbenv local &lt;ruby-version&gt;</code> in your <code>$HOME</code> folder. Doing <code>$ rbenv global &lt;ruby-version&gt;</code> modifies the <code>$HOME/.rbenv/version</code> file, and the existence of a <code>.ruby-version</code> file in the <code>$HOME</code> folder would override the version set by <code>$HOME/.rbenv/version</code>.</p>
<p>From the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing the Ruby Version
When you execute a shim, rbenv determines which Ruby version to use by reading it from the following sources, in this order:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The RBENV_VERSION environment variable, if specified. You can use the rbenv shell command to set this environment variable in your current shell session.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first .ruby-version file found by searching the directory of the script you are executing and each of its parent directories until reaching the root of your filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first .ruby-version file found by searching the current working directory and each of its parent directories until reaching the root of your filesystem. You can modify the .ruby-version file in the current working directory with the rbenv local command.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The global ~/.rbenv/version file. You can modify this file using the rbenv global command. If the global version file is not present, rbenv assumes you want to use the &quot;system&quot; Ruby—i.e. whatever version would be run if rbenv weren't in your path.</p>

<p>My problem persisted after many of the recommended solutions above. Like the OP, I installed rbenv and then a ruby version, but my laptop defaulted to system. What I had overlooked was that when I ran:</p>

<pre><code>[~/.rbenv] $ rbenv versions
* system (set by /Users/alphadogg/.rbenv/version)
  2.0.0-p247
</code></pre>

<p>IOW, it was still defaulting to system. A quick</p>

<pre><code>[~/.rbenv] $ rbenv local 2.0.0-p247
</code></pre>

<p>switched it to the new version.</p>
<h4> Comment 42782111 Steve Midgley: </h4>Yes - funny how rbenv install guides don&#39;t mention running the local command at all. Lots of blogs remind you to run rbenv global but not local.

I had stopped using rvm awhile ago and changed to rbenv.  Deleted .ruby-versions and ran rbenv versions again and it had the latest selected by rbenv ( be sure you have the eval statement above in .bash_profile!).  Now, all works as before.  Thanks for helping me get this solved.<br><h4> Comment 49642491 Mark Glossop: </h4>Same problem. Same solution. (May have to look at submitting a PR to advise when global Ruby version is overruled by a ~/.ruby-version...)<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 39238995 Sky Notify: </h3><p>First step is to find out which ruby is being called:</p>
<pre><code>$ which ruby
</code></pre>
<p>Your system says:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/ruby
</code></pre>
<p>This is NOT the shim used by rbenv, which (on MacOS) should look like:</p>
<pre><code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/.rbenv/shims/ruby
</code></pre>
<p>The shim is actually a script that acts like a redirect to the version of ruby you set.</p>
<p>I recommend that for trouble shooting you unset the project specific &quot;local&quot; version, and the shell specific &quot;shell&quot; version and just test using the &quot;global&quot; version setting which is determined in a plain text file in ~/.rbenv/version which will just be the version number &quot;1.9.3&quot; in your case.</p>
<pre><code>$ rbenv global 1.9.3
$ rbenv local --unset
$ rbenv shell --unset
</code></pre>
<p>You can do <code>ls -laG</code> in the root of your project folder (not the home folder) to make sure there is no longer a &quot;.ruby-version&quot; file there.</p>
<p>You can use <code>rbenv versions</code> to identify which version rbenv is set to use (and the location and name of the file that is setting that):</p>
<pre><code>$ rbenv versions
</code></pre>
<p>NONE OF THAT MATTERS until you set the path correctly.</p>
<p>Use this to make sure your *MacOS will obey you:</p>
<pre><code>$ rbenv init -
</code></pre>
<p>Followed by:</p>
<pre><code>$ which ruby
</code></pre>
<p>To make sure it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/.rbenv/shims/ruby
</code></pre>
<p>Then run this to add the line to your profile so it runs each time you open a new terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo 'eval &quot;$(rbenv init -)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>
<p>There are other ways to modify the path, feel free to substitute any of them instead of running the rbenv init.</p>
<p>NOTE: reinstall Rails with:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install rails
</code></pre>
<p>If you were trying to run Ruby on Rails, then you need to have this all working first, then install the rails gem again.  A previous install of Rails will use a hard coded path to the wrong ruby and several other things will be in the wrong place, so just install the gem again.</p>
<p>P. S. If your MacOS won't obey you (*mentioned above) then you may have to find another way to modify your path, but that's unlikely to be a problem because &quot;Macs just work&quot; ;)</p>

Tried about 25 different solutions before I found this one, thank you<br><h4> Comment 112429984 Jerome: </h4>this response is the most helpful (and complete) one.  One small variant:  <code>if which rbenv &gt; &#47;dev&#47;null; then eval &quot;$(rbenv init -)&quot;; fi &gt;&gt; ~&#47;.bash_profile</code>  followed by <code>source ~&#47;.bash_profile</code><br><h4> Comment 130042524 Alex Glover: </h4>Don&#39;t know why, but running <code>$ rbenv local --unset; rbenv shell --unset</code> and setting the global version worked for me. Even after restoring the <code>.ruby-version</code> file with the same version number, rbenv started working as expected.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 68123451 Promise Preston: </h3><p>I had this issue when setting up Ruby using rbenv on <strong>MacBook Pro Catalina OS</strong> and <strong>MacBook Pro Big Sur</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's how I fixed:</p>
<p>First run the command below to initialize rbenv:</p>
<pre><code>rbenv init
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you some instruction on what to do. Basically you will have to open the <code>~/.zshrc</code> file and add this to the file <code>eval &quot;$(rbenv init -)&quot;</code>. You can accomplish this by running the command below:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'eval &quot;$(rbenv init -)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
</code></pre>
<p>Next, run the command below to set your Ruby version:</p>
<pre><code>rbenv local &lt;your-desired-ruby-version&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, my desired Ruby version was 3.0.1, so it was:</p>
<pre><code>rbenv local 3.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>When you are done, quit your terminal using <strong>Command + Q</strong>, and then open a new terminal, this time when you run the command:</p>
<pre><code>ruby -v 
rbenv versions
</code></pre>
<p>You will see that your desired Ruby version has already been set up for you.</p>

<p>Even if you have <code>rbenv</code> installed, your computer could still serve the default ruby version. To fix this, just run the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>rbenv init
</code></pre>
<p>This might give an output like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code># Load rbenv automatically by appending
# the following to ~/.zshrc:

eval &quot;$(rbenv init - zsh)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Just open your <code>.zshrc</code> file:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>sudo nano ~/.zshrc
</code></pre>
<p>(Or you can also open this file with any other text editor)</p>
<p>Add this line:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>eval &quot;$(rbenv init - zsh)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Save the file (if used sudo nano, you can do so like this:)
<code>CTRL + X</code> then <code>Y</code> then <code>Enter</code> (For Mac)</p>
<p>Now, refresh your <code>.zshrc</code> profile like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>source ~/.zshrc
</code></pre>
<p>Now type <code>ruby --version</code>, this must give you the ruby version that was provided by <code>rbenv</code>.</p>

In my case it looks similar to:</p>

<pre><code># Which plugins would you like to load? (plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*)
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(git bower rails ruby rbenv gulp npm node nvm sublime)
</code></pre>

<p>After that there're no problems when installing, switching, using ruby versions with help of <code>rbenv</code>.</p>

<p>Mind to restart your terminal session after made changes.</p>

<pre><code>export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
</code></pre>

<p>This will not work on Mac OSX, which the OP references. In fact, if you install rbenv via <code>brew install rbenv</code>, which is really the only installation method in Mac OSX, since <code>curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash</code> will FAIL in OSX, then the rbenv executable will be installed in:</p>

<pre><code>$ which rbenv
/usr/local/bin/rbenv
</code></pre>

<p>However, even in OSX, the rbenv root will remain in the $HOME directory:</p>

<pre><code>~ viggy$ rbenv root
/Users/viggy/.rbenv
</code></pre>

<p>What does this mean? It means when you install rubies, they will install in the given home directory under .rbenv:</p>

<pre><code>$ rbenv install 2.6.0
$ ls ~/.rbenv/versions
2.6.0
</code></pre>

<p>Now the brew installation did some work that you would have to perform manually in Linux. For example, in Linux, you would have to install ruby-build manually as a plugin:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir -p "$(rvbenv root)/plugins"
$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build
</code></pre>

<p>This is already done with the homebrew installation. There is one important step that must be done in the homebrew installation, as in the Linux installation. You must add the rbenv shims to your path. In order to do that, when your shell starts, you have to evaluate the following command (which will in turn add the rbenv shims to the beginning of your $PATH):</p>

<pre><code>$ vim ~/.bash_profile
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
$ source ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<p>Now when you run <code>echo $PATH</code>, you will see the rbenv shims:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/Users/viggy/.rbenv/shims:
</code></pre>

<p>Now check your ruby version and it will reflect the rbenv ruby installed:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -v
ruby 2.6.0p0 
</code></pre>

Fixed this by run the <code>rbenv global</code> command with <code>sudo</code>.
I think it was something permission problem.</p>
<p>update:
I finally found the solution.
There was one same file &quot;version&quot; on my mac,  which is under <code>/usr/local/Cellar/rbenv/0.3.0/</code>.
I think it was created by mistake occasionally. you should remove it.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 13194638 David: </h3><p>When I had these symptoms, the problem turned out to be that install had failed halfway through for the new Ruby version I was trying to switch to, without me noticing. The fix was to delete &amp; reinstall it.</p>

<p>(This meant that even though ruby 1.9.3 showed up in the rbenv list of available versions, it didn't have an executable on the path where rbenv assumed it would. Since rbenv tries to change your ruby version just by prepending a location to your path, if there's nothing actually in the location it prepends, your OS will happily continue searching your default path and find your system version, in my case like the question's 1.8.7.)</p>

<p>The rbenv docs point us to the rbenv-doctor diagnostic tool that will quickly verify all these potential pitfalls on your system:</p>
<pre><code>curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
</code></pre>
<p>When all is well, you'll see this:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash                                     &lt;aws:hd-pmp-developer&gt;

<p>Now, if we break one of those expectations (e.g. remove rbenv-install), the tool will point us directly to the problem, with a link to how to fix it:</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 75603798 Suresh B B: </h3><p>HOW TO INSTALL RUBY RBENV
Just like many other tools, we turn to the popular Homebrew macOS package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>brew install rbenv ruby-build
</code></pre>
<p>Once everything is installed, we need to instruct rbenv to setup our shell, so we’re using the Ruby runtime version that we’ve customly installed with rbenv whenever we open a new terminal window to type commands in the prompt (as opposed to the preinstalled Ruby 2.6.8 version on the macOS).</p>
<p>To setup rbenv with your shell run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>rbenv init
</code></pre>
<p>Follow the on-screen printed instructions if any extra configuration is required on your part. You might be asked to paste a command in your shell’s configuration. If you’re on a macOS and haven’t changed from the default Z Shell (ZSH), then you’ll want to make sure you add the following line of code to the top of your ~/.zshrc file:</p>
<pre><code>eval &quot;$(rbenv init - zsh)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The rbenv install process is now complete. You might want to run some diagnostic checks to ensure that everything is set up correctly. If so, you can run the rbenv-doctor tool that the rbenv GitHub project provides:</p>
<p>Open a new terminal window so that you have the new rbenv environment loaded
Run the command:
curl -fsSL <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-doctor</a> | zsh
Warning: This command shouldn’t be taken lightly, as you are piping commands into your development environment’s shell that originate from a public and open source GitHub repository. It is possible that a malicious actor had tampered with the source code, so you are highly encouraged to review the code properly before you run this command.</p>
<p>How do you use rbenv to install a new Ruby version?
Congrats on building your own Ruby virtual environment! Now that you have a functional rbenv setup we can use it to completely manage your Ruby versions.</p>
<p>To begin, you want to list which Ruby versions are available for installation so you can choose the latest Ruby release, or perhaps a specific version that you’re looking for. To use rbenv to list all Ruby versions, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>rbenv install -l
</code></pre>
<p>The output of which was:</p>
<p>2.6.10
2.7.6
3.0.4
3.1.2
jruby-9.3.6.0
mruby-3.1.0
picoruby-3.0.0
rbx-5.0
truffleruby-22.1.0
truffleruby+graalvm-22.1.0</p>
<p>Only latest stable releases for each Ruby implementation are shown.
Use 'rbenv install --list-all / -L' to show all local versions.
You can then proceed to installing one of these Ruby versions. Let’s use rbenv to install a Ruby version of 3.1.2:</p>
<pre><code>rbenv install 3.1.2
</code></pre>
<p>The command will then start fetching the relevant source code files to extract, compile, and then install the Ruby 3.1.2 runtime version available to your shell.</p>
<p>When you’ve finished installing it, you should set it to be the chosen version anytime your shell starts. To do that, you need to run:</p>
<pre><code>rbenv global 3.1.2
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can verify that this is working as expected by running the ruby --version in your shell, which should output a similar result:</p>
