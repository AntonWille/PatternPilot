 <h2> Title: What are the Python equivalents to Ruby&#39;s bundler / Perl&#39;s carton? </h2> <h4> riywo, question_id: 8726207 </h4>Score: 99, Tags: {python,ruby,perl,virtualenv,pip} <br><p>I know about virtualenv and pip. But these are a bit different from bundler/carton.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>pip writes the absolute path to shebang or activate script</li>
<li>pip doesn't have the <code>exec</code> sub command (<code>bundle exec bar</code>)</li>
<li>virtualenv copies the Python interpreter to a local directory</li>
</ul>

<p>Does every Python developer use virtualenv/pip? Are there other package management tools for Python?</p>

You can think of it as something between regular gem command and bundler. Common things that you can do with pip:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Installing packages (gem install)</strong></p>

<pre><code>pip install mypackage
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Dependencies and bulk-install (gemfile)</strong></p>

<p>Probably the easiest way is to use pip's requirements.txt files. Basically it's just a plain list of required packages with possible version constraints. It might look something like:</p>

<pre><code>nose==1.1.2
django&lt;1.3
PIL
</code></pre>

<p>Later when you'd want to install those dependencies you would do:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<p>A simple way to see all your current packages in requirements-file syntax is to do:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip freeze
</code></pre>

<p>You can read more about it <a href="http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Execution (bundler exec)</strong></p>

<p>All python packages that come with executable files are usually directly available after install (unless you have custom setup or it's a special package). For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install gunicorn
$ gunicorn -h 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Package gems for install from cache (bundler package)</strong></p>

<p>There is <code>pip bundle</code> and <code>pip zip/unzip</code>. But i'm not sure if many people use it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>p.s.</strong> If you do care about environment isolation you can also use virtualenv together with pip (they are close friends and work perfectly together). By default pip installs packages system-wide which might require admin rights. </p>
<h4> Debilski, Comment 10979961 Score: 50: </h4>The great thing about bundler is exactly that the <i>virtualenv</i> part is integrated and in most cases no admin rights are required. In fact, bundle may well be the only gem one needs globally. <code>bundle install --path vendor</code> installs everything locally and <code>bundle exec</code> is smart enough to figure that out. No need for explicit environment changes.<br><h4> Sean Mackesey, Comment 24947832 Score: 12: </h4>I don&#39;t think point #3 is correct.  Simply running a ruby executable can be done with or without <code>bundle exec</code>. The whole point of <code>bundle exec</code> is that it alters the environment as per the <code>Gemfile</code> before running the executable. Pip has no equivalent to <code>bundle exec</code>, though virtualenv might.<br><h4> ocodo, Comment 27053803 Score: 12: </h4>The main thing about bundler is it is a defacto standard now, you can pretty much guarantee that ANY ruby project of virtually any size, will have a <code>Gemfile</code> sat in it&#39;s root, and you can <code>bundle install</code> and you&#39;re good to go, or <code>bundle --deployment</code> and it&#39;ll just run on a server with little else to do providing the machine has the required version of ruby on it.

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>$ pip install pipenv

<p>Pipenv creates virtualenv automatically and installs dependencies from <code>Pipfile</code> or <code>Pipfile.lock</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ pipenv --three           # Create virtualenv with Python3
$ pipenv install           # Install dependencies from Pipfile
$ pipenv install requests  # Install `requests` and update Pipfile
$ pipenv lock              # Generate `Pipfile.lock`
$ pipenv shell             # Run shell with virtualenv activated
</code></pre>

<p>You can run command with virtualenv scope like <code>bundle exec</code>.</p>

<p>The version that is currently in pip simply reads the <code>requirements.txt</code> file you already have, but is much out of date. It's also not totally equivalent: it insists on making a <code>virtualenv</code>. Bundler, I notice, only installs what packages are missing, and gives you the option of giving your sudo password to install into your system dirs or of restarting, which doesn't seem to be a feature of pbundler.</p>

<p>However, the version on git is an almost complete rewrite to be much closer to Bundler's behaviour... including having a "Cheesefile" and now not supporting requirements.txt. This is unfortunate, since requirements.txt is the de facto standard in pythonland, and there's even Offical BDFL-stamped work to <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/" rel="nofollow">standardize it</a>. When that comes into force, you can be sure that something like pbundler will become the de facto standard. Alas, nothing quite stable yet that I know of (but I would <em>love</em> to be proven wrong).</p>

<p>It uses virtualenvs behind the scenes (in contrast to bundler), but it provides and uses a lock-file, takes care of sub dependencies, adheres to specified version constraints and allows automatically updating outdated packages. There's even autocompletion for your favorite shell.</p>

<p>With its use of a pyproject.toml file, it's also going a bit further than bundler (closer to a gemspec. It's also comparable to JavaScript's and TypeScript's npm and yarn).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kk6/poetrify" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Poetrify</a> (a complementing project) helps converting projects from requirements.txt to pyproject.toml for Poetry.</p>

<p>And now, for package development tools and diferent environments that is your real question. Exist any other tools like Buildout (<a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/</a>) for the same purpose, isolate your environment Python build system for every project that you manage.

<p>Independent environments per project, in Python are a little different that the same situation in Ruby. In my case i use pyenv (<a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv</a>) that is something like rbenv but, for Python. diferent versions of python and virtualenvs per project, and, in this isolated environments, i can use pip or easy-install (if is needed).</p>
