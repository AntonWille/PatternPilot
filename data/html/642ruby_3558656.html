  <p>Here is a custom script which we name as <code>cleanout-rvm</code>. While you can definitely use <code>rvm implode</code> as a regular user or <code>rvmsudo rvm implode</code> for a system wide install, this script is useful as it steps completely outside of RVM and cleans out RVM without using RVM itself, leaving no traces.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to fix the PATH so that the <code>rvm</code> command also disappears from the terminal.</p>
<p>To check your PATH:</p>
<pre><code>env | grep PATH

<p>To fix your PATH removing RVM directories:</p>
<pre><code>dir_to_remove=/home/user/.rvm/bin
PATH=:$PATH:
PATH=${PATH//:$dir_to_remove:/:}
PATH=${PATH#:}; PATH=${PATH%:}

<p>In this case, if you have more than one directory, change <code>dir_to_remove</code> one at a time.</p>
