 <h2> Title: Begin, Rescue and Ensure in Ruby? </h2> <h4> Lloyd Powell, question_id: 2191632, created_at: 2010-02-03 11:54:15+00:00 </h4>Score: 625, Tags: {ruby-on-rails,ruby,exception,error-handling} <br><p>I've recently started programming in Ruby, and I am looking at exception handling.</p>

<p>I was wondering if <code>ensure</code> was the Ruby equivalent of <code>finally</code> in C#? Should I have:</p>

<pre><code>file = File.open("myFile.txt", "w")

begin
  file &lt;&lt; "#{content} \n"
rescue
  #handle the error here
ensure
  file.close unless file.nil?
end
</code></pre>

<p>or should I do this?</p>

<pre><code>#store the file
file = File.open("myFile.txt", "w")

begin
  file &lt;&lt; "#{content} \n"
  file.close
rescue
  #handle the error here
ensure
  file.close unless file.nil?
end
</code></pre>

<p>Does <code>ensure</code> get called no matter what, even if an exception isn't raised?</p>
<h4> Comment by Nowaker, Score: 2, Id: 92236735, created_at: 2018-10-04 17:38:16+00:00 </h4>Neither is good. As a rule, when dealing with external resources, you <b>always</b> want the resource opening` to be inside the <code>begin</code> block.<hr><h3> ✔️ Answer by J&#246;rg W Mittag, Id: 2192010, Score: 1325, created_at: 2010-02-03 13:04:35+00:00 </h3><p>Yes, <code>ensure</code> ensures that the code is always evaluated. That's why it's called <code>ensure</code>. So, it is equivalent to Java's and C#'s <code>finally</code>.</p>
<p>The general flow of <code>begin</code>/<code>rescue</code>/<code>else</code>/<code>ensure</code>/<code>end</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>begin
  # something which might raise an exception
rescue SomeExceptionClass =&gt; some_variable
  # code that deals with some exception
rescue SomeOtherException =&gt; some_other_variable
  # code that deals with some other exception
else
  # code that runs only if *no* exception was raised
ensure
  # ensure that this code always runs, no matter what
  # does not change the final value of the block
end
</code></pre>
<p>You can leave out <code>rescue</code>, <code>ensure</code> or <code>else</code>. You can also leave out the variables in which case you won't be able to inspect the exception in your exception handling code. (Well, you can always use the global exception variable to access the last exception that was raised, but that's a little bit hacky.) And you can leave out the exception class, in which case all exceptions that inherit from <code>StandardError</code> will be caught. (Please note that this does not mean that <em>all</em> exceptions are caught, because there are exceptions which are instances of <code>Exception</code> but not <code>StandardError</code>. Mostly very severe exceptions that compromise the integrity of the program such as <code>SystemStackError</code>, <code>NoMemoryError</code>, <code>SecurityError</code>, <code>NotImplementedError</code>, <code>LoadError</code>, <code>SyntaxError</code>, <code>ScriptError</code>, <code>Interrupt</code>, <code>SignalException</code> or <code>SystemExit</code>.)</p>
<p>Some blocks form implicit exception blocks. For example, method definitions are implicitly also exception blocks, so instead of writing</p>
<pre><code>def foo
  begin
    # ...
  rescue
    # ...
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>you write just</p>
<pre><code>def foo
  # ...
rescue
  # ...
end
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>def foo
  # ...
ensure
  # ...
end
</code></pre>
<p>The same applies to <code>class</code> definitions and <code>module</code> definitions.</p>
<p>However, in the specific case you are asking about, there is actually a much better idiom. In general, when you work with some resource which you need to clean up at the end, you do that by passing a block to a method which does all the cleanup for you. It's similar to a <code>using</code> block in C#, except that Ruby is actually powerful enough that you don't have to wait for the high priests of Microsoft to come down from the mountain and graciously change their compiler for you. In Ruby, you can just implement it yourself:</p>
<pre><code># This is what you want to do:
File.open('myFile.txt', 'w') do |file|
  file.puts content
end

# And this is how you might implement it:
def File.open(filename, mode='r', perm=nil, opt=nil)
  yield filehandle = new(filename, mode, perm, opt)
ensure
  filehandle&amp;.close
end
</code></pre>
<p>And what do you know: this is <em>already</em> available in the core library as <code>File.open</code>. But it is a general pattern that you can use in your own code as well, for implementing any kind of resource cleanup (à la <code>using</code> in C#) or transactions or whatever else you might think of.</p>
<p>The only case where this doesn't work, if acquiring and releasing the resource are distributed over different parts of the program. But if it is localized, as in your example, then you can easily use these resource blocks.</p>
<hr />
<p>BTW: in modern C#, <code>using</code> is actually superfluous, because you can implement Ruby-style resource blocks yourself:</p>
<pre class="lang-csharp prettyprint-override"><code>class File
{
    static T open&lt;T&gt;(string filename, string mode, Func&lt;File, T&gt; block)
    {
        var handle = new File(filename, mode);
        try
        {
            return block(handle);
        }
        finally
        {
            handle.Dispose();
        }
    }
}

// Usage:

File.open(&quot;myFile.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, (file) =&gt;
{
    file.WriteLine(contents);
});

In fact, as of C♯ 3, you <i>can</i> write <code>using</code> as a library method taking an <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> or <code>Func&lt;T, R&gt;</code> (where <code>T : IDisposable</code>) and centralizing the <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> in one single place in the library.

<p>By the way, a good way to test is to do:</p>

<pre><code>begin
  # Raise an error here
  raise "Error!!"
rescue
  #handle the error here
ensure
  p "=========inside ensure block"
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can test to see if "=========inside ensure block" will be printed out when there is an exception.
Then you can comment out the statement that raises the error and see if the <code>ensure</code> statement is executed by seeing if anything gets printed out.</p>
