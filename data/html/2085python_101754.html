 <h2> Title: Is there a way to run Python on Android? </h2> <h3> Bite code, question_id: 101754 </h3>Score: 2085, Tags: {android,python,jython,ase,android-scripting} <br><p>We are working on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_%28software_platform%29" rel="noreferrer">S60</a> version and this platform has a nice Python API..</p>

<p>However, there is nothing official about Python on Android, but since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython" rel="noreferrer">Jython</a> exists, is there a way to let the snake and the robot work together??</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 8189603 JohnMudd: </h3><p>One way is to use <a href="http://kivy.org/" rel="noreferrer">Kivy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source Python library for rapid development of applications
  that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kivy runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android and iOS. You can run the same [python] code on all supported platforms.</p>

Their main developers were very quick to answer questions on IRC however if you&#39;ve programmed a GUI before Kivy will make you say WTF quite a bit. Some examples of undocumented things that were weird for me: All widgets get every on_touch_down event even if the event occurred outside their region, No widget has a draw() method, almost everything happens via a custom observer pattern on custom Properties they made up (note these share the name with Python&#39;s property, but are not the same)<br><h4> Comment 12553636 Tadeck: </h4>@Trey: What about non-GUI-related things? Are there any limitations regarding usage of Python&#39;s modules? What about access to Android-specific features, such as ability to read messages, add notification, work in the background, make a photo, read contacts list, determine GPS location etc.?<br><h4> Comment 14821848 rubik: </h4>And now there is iOS support too!<br><h4> Comment 117649765 nihilok: </h4>On the theme of limitations, one huge drawback of Kivy remains the inability to have text inputs that accept native keyboard suggestions from your device&#39;s keyboard (e.g. Gboard/Swiftkey) You only get the email/password type keyboard that doesn&#39;t offer suggestions. Tried for weeks to find a solution including modifying the java source code where it was switched off, but no dice (still doesn&#39;t work). Really huge limiting factor, although I don&#39;t really use keyboard suggestions, anyone who uses the app I made that is always their first question haha &quot;why no suggestions/autocorrect?&quot;<br><h4> Comment 51806070 inclement: </h4>To answer the old question of @Tadeck: Kivy has direct access to Android-specific features via <a href="https://pyjnius.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyjnius</a> and (for a more pythonic wrapper) <a href="https://github.com/kivy/plyer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">plyer</a>.

<p>The examples include a complete game packaged as an APK, which is pretty interesting.</p>
<h4> Comment 9319312 gdw2: </h4>Several aspects were broken on my Droid X (buttons, or touchscreen, can&#39;t remember), so I didn&#39;t get very far with this route.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 256069 lacker: </h3><p>As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Python</a> lover and Android programmer, I'm sad to say this is not a good way to go. There are two problems:</p>

<p>One problem is that there is a lot more than just a programming language to the Android development tools. A lot of the Android graphics involve XML files to configure the display, similar to HTML. The built-in java objects are integrated with this XML layout, and it's a lot easier than writing your code to go from logic to bitmap.</p>

<p>The other problem is that the G1 (and probably other Android devices for the near future) are not that fast. 200 MHz processors and RAM is very limited. Even in Java, you have to do a decent amount of rewriting-to-avoid-more-object-creation if you want to make your app perfectly smooth. Python is going to be too slow for a while still on mobile devices.</p>
<h4> Comment 115932 Bite code: </h4>There is not a single java word on an Android phone, it&#39;s compiled to byte code during the packaging process. Speed is not the issue : Google could provide tools producing the right byte code from a python code (like for Jython). BTW, Dalvik is not  the Java VM so this is not about Java VS Python.<br><h4> Comment 47259866 Rohan Kandwal: </h4>@Touzen 2 more years later, we are running Intel Atom processor or octa-core processors now. ;)<br><h4> Comment 35784257 LtWorf: </h4>JAVA bytecode still needs to be processed by a JVM, and the Java language requires a garbage collector anyway. Actual speed could only come from C++.<br><h4> Comment 89549450 Alex: </h4>By the way Google pushes Kotlin these days - which is a pretty unknown language to most users - it is clear that it&#39;s possible to support other languages than Java (I&#39;m a Java dev and a Python fan). So I think the answer is rather a political one than a practical one.<br><h4> Comment 55955445 Evgeni Sergeev: </h4>Due to the difference in the power they are able to draw, phones will always be an order of magnitude slower than desktops. However, don&#39;t give up on Python for the mobile device, because typically only a fraction of the code is responsible for the processor-intensive work, and this fraction can be optimised by rewriting it in another language.<br><h4> Comment 96680611 Kjeld Schmidt: </h4>@Alex To be fair, Kotlin natively runs and compiles on the JVM, so integrating it is much easier than a non-JVM-language.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 9773282 Carl Smith: </h3><h1>Scripting Layer for Android</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/damonkohler/sl4a" rel="noreferrer">SL4A</a> does what you want. You can easily install it directly onto your device from their site, and do not need root.</p>

<p>It supports a range of languages. Python is the most mature. By default, it uses Python 2.6, but there is a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/python-for-android/wiki/Python3" rel="noreferrer">3.2 port</a> you can use instead. I have used that port for all kinds of things on a Galaxy S2 and it worked fine.</p>

<h2>API</h2>

<p>SL4A provides a port of their <code>android</code> library for each supported language. The library provides an interface to the underlying Android API through a single <code>Android</code> object.</p>

<pre><code>from android import Android

droid = Android()
droid.ttsSpeak('hello world') # example using the text to speech facade
</code></pre>

<p>Each language has pretty much the same API. You can even use the JavaScript API inside webviews.</p>

<pre><code>let droid = new Android();
droid.ttsSpeak("hello from js");
</code></pre>

<h2>User Interfaces</h2>

<p>For user interfaces, you have three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can easily use the generic, native dialogues and menus through the
API. This is good for confirmation dialogues and other basic user inputs.</li>
<li>You can also open a webview from inside a Python script, then use HTML5
for the user interface. When you use webviews from Python, you can pass
messages back and forth, between the webview and the Python process that
spawned it. The UI will not be native, but it is still a good option to
have.</li>
<li>There is <em>some</em> support for native Android user interfaces, but I am not
sure how well it works; I just haven't ever used it.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can mix options, so you can have a webview for the main interface, and still use native dialogues.</p>

<h2>QPython</h2>

<p>There is a third party project named <a href="http://qpython.com" rel="noreferrer">QPython</a>. It builds on SL4A, and throws in some other useful stuff.</p>

<p>QPython gives you a nicer UI to manage your installation, and includes a little, touchscreen code editor, a Python shell, and a PIP shell for package management. They also have a Python 3 port. Both versions are available from the Play Store, free of charge. QPython also bundles libraries from a bunch of Python on Android projects, including Kivy, so it is not just SL4A.</p>

<p>Note that QPython still develop their fork of SL4A (though, not much to be honest). The main SL4A project itself is pretty much dead.</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 27913916 Anzel: </h3><h1>Kivy</h1>

<p>I wanted to add to what @JohnMudd has written about Kivy. It has been years since the situation he described, and Kivy has evolved substantially.</p>

<p>The biggest selling point of Kivy, in my opinion, is its cross-platform compatibility. You can code and test everything using any desktop environment (Windows/*nix etc.), then package your app for a range of different platforms, including Android, iOS, MacOS and Windows (though apps often lack the native look and feel).</p>

<p>With Kivy's own <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/guide/lang.html#kv-language" rel="noreferrer">KV</a> language, you can code and build the GUI interface easily (it's just like Java XML, but rather than TextView etc., KV has its own <code>ui.widgets</code> for a similar translation), which is in my opinion quite easy to adopt.</p>

<p>Currently <a href="https://github.com/kivy/buildozer" rel="noreferrer">Buildozer</a> and <a href="http://python-for-android.readthedocs.org/en/latest/prerequisites/" rel="noreferrer">python-for-android</a> are the most recommended tools to build and package your apps. I have tried them both and can firmly say that they make building Android apps with Python a breeze. Their guides are well documented too.</p>

<p>iOS is another big selling point of Kivy. You can use the same code base with few changes required via <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-ios.html#create-a-package-for-ios" rel="noreferrer">kivy-ios</a> Homebrew tools, although Xcode is required for the build, before running on their devices (AFAIK the iOS Simulator in Xcode currently doesn't work for the x86-architecture build). There are also some dependency issues which must be manually compiled and fiddled around with in Xcode to have a successful build, but they wouldn't be too difficult to resolve and people in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kivy-users" rel="noreferrer">Kivy Google Group</a> are really helpful too.</p>

<p>With all that being said, users with good Python knowledge should have no problem picking up the basics quickly.</p>

<p>If you are using Kivy for more serious projects, you may find existing modules unsatisfactory. There are some workable solutions though. With the (work in progress) <a href="https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius" rel="noreferrer">pyjnius</a> for Android, and <a href="https://github.com/kivy/pyobjus" rel="noreferrer">pyobjus</a>, users can now access Java/Objective-C classes to control some of the native APIs.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 101787 Ilya Kochetov: </h3><p>Making Android apps with Python has come a long way in the past couple of years.</p>
<p>One new way is using the <a href="https://github.com/Embarcadero/DelphiFMX4Python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FireMonkey (FMX) framework for Python</a>. FMX is a GUI framework for developing apps for many platforms, with Android being one of them.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/Embarcadero/PythonFMXBuilder" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PythonFMXBuilder</a> to build your Android App once you're finished programming it.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 8759409 gdw2: </h3><p>Using SL4A (which has already been mentioned by itself in other answers) you can <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/web2py/browse_thread/thread/f227e93fe802a902" rel="noreferrer">run</a> a full-blown <a href="http://web2py.com/" rel="noreferrer">web2py</a> instance (other <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="noreferrer">python web frameworks</a> are likely candidates as well).  SL4A doesn't allow you to do native UI components (buttons, scroll bars, and the like), but it does support <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/UsingWebView" rel="noreferrer">WebViews</a>.  A WebView is basically nothing more than a striped down web browser pointed at a fixed address. I believe the native Gmail app uses a WebView instead of going the regular widget route.  </p>

<p>This route would have some interesting features:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the case of most python web frameworks, you could actually develop and test without using an android device or android emulator.</li>
<li>Whatever Python code you end up writing for the phone could also be put on a public webserver with very little (if any)  modification.</li>
<li>You could take advantage of all of the crazy web stuff out there: query, HTML5, CSS3, etc.</li>

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 15335213 Hitul: </h3><p>You can run your Python code using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">sl4a</a>. sl4a supports Python, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby">JRuby</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_%28programming_language%29">Lua</a>, BeanShell, JavaScript, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tcl</a>, and shell script.</p>

<p>You can learn sl4a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/Tutorials">Python Examples</a>.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 39523019 ode2k: </h3><p>You can use <strong>QPython</strong>:</p>

<p>It has a Python Console, Editor, as well as Package Management / Installers</p>

<p><a href="http://qpython.com/" rel="noreferrer">http://qpython.com/</a></p>

<p>It's an open source project with both Python 2 and Python 3 implementations. You can download the source and the Android .apk files directly from github.</p>

<p>QPython 2: <a href="https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython/releases" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython/releases</a></p>

<p>QPython 3: <a href="https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython3/releases" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython3/releases</a></p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 28719773 Brian S: </h3><p>Another option if you are looking for 3.4.2 or newer (3.9.6 as of this writing) is this archive on GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rave-engine/python3-android" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python3-Android 3.4.2</a> or <a href="https://github.com/GRRedWings/python3-android" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python3-Android 3.9.6</a></p>
<p>I believe the original archive supports Python 3.4.2, the latest GRRedwings branch support 3.9.6 and the 22b version of the NDK. Older branches support other versions, but are not as easy to compile with docker.</p>
<p>The older version you simply clone the archive, run make and you get the .so or the .a</p>
<p>The newer versions follow the ReadMe, but it uses docker for consistent builds.</p>
<p>I currently use this to run raw Python on android devices. With a couple modifications to the build files you can also make x86 and armeabi 64 bit</p>

<h4> Comment 106575217 Carsten Thielepape: </h4>What is the difference toi Kivy? It is stable portable python Gui based<br>------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 26219028 radix07: </h3><p>Didn't see this posted here, but you can do it with Pyside and Qt now that Qt works on Android thanks to Necessitas.</p>

<p>It seems like quite a kludge at the moment but could be a viable route eventually...</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 30294060 Andrzej Pronobis: </h3><p>One more option seems to be <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/pyqtdeploy/index.html" rel="noreferrer">pyqtdeploy</a> which citing the docs is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a tool that, in conjunction with other tools provided with Qt, enables
  the deployment of PyQt4 and PyQt5 applications written with Python
  v2.7 or Python v3.3 or later. It supports deployment to desktop
  platforms (Linux, Windows and OS X) and to mobile platforms (iOS and
  Android).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24239684/deploying-pyqt5-application-to-android-via-pyqtdeploy-and-qt5">Deploying PyQt5 application to Android via pyqtdeploy and Qt5</a> it is actively developed, although it is difficult to find examples of working Android apps or tutorial on how to cross-compile all the required libraries to Android. It is an interesting project to keep in mind though!</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------ <br><h3> Answer 48285300 frmdstryr: </h3><p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native" rel="noreferrer">enaml-native</a> which takes the react-native concept and applies it to python. </p>

<p>It lets users build apps with native Android widgets and provides APIs to use android and java libraries from python. </p>

<p>It also integrates with android-studio and shares a few of react's nice dev features like code reloading and remote debugging.</p>
