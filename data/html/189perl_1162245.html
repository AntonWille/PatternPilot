<h4> Comment by tetromino, Score: 18, Id: 57806205, created_at: 2016-01-27 15:08:06+00:00 </h4>@shampoo slash operator creates a reference, a bit like the <code>&amp;</code> operator in C and C++. The reason it matters in this context is that in Perl, if you call a function with a hash value as the argument, that hash value gets listified and expanded into multiple arguments - so <code>%hsh=(&quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2); foo(%hsh);</code> would be equivalent to <code>foo(&quot;a&quot;, 1, &quot;b&quot;, 2)</code>. If you instead want the function to operate on the hash itself, you need to pass a reference to the hash: <code>foo(\%hsh);</code> See <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html#Pass-by-Reference" rel="nofollow noreferrer">perldoc.perl.org/perlsub.html#Pass-by-Reference</a><h4> Comment by shampoo, Score: 6, Id: 57711438, created_at: 2016-01-25 11:38:17+00:00 </h4>What does it mean to add a slash in front of the % ?<h4> Comment by plusplus, Score: 3, Id: 983040, created_at: 2009-07-22 08:08:42+00:00 </h4>the original poster might also want to look into the various Data::Dumper options, in particular turning on &#39;Sortkeys&#39; can be very useful<h4> Comment by Sos, Score: 1, Id: 34842808, created_at: 2014-04-03 15:20:00+00:00 </h4>@JonathanDay I was missing that detail and it was helpful!

Also, having written scripts that check every module that I put into production prep that it doesn&#39;t <code>use</code> <code>Smart::Comments</code>, I see it from that perspective too. But to the counter, <code>Smart::Comments</code> is pretty well behaved as a <i>scoped</i> module, there shouldn&#39;t be output behavior in any module that doesn&#39;t also <i>use</i> SC. So, the problem would be isolated to those scopes with a <i>use</i> statement.
